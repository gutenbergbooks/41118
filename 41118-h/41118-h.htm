<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>When General Edward Braddock
landed in Virginia in 1755, one of
his first acts in his campaign upon
the Ohio was to urge Governor Morris to
have a road opened westward through
Pennsylvania. His reason for wishing
another road, parallel to the one his own
army was to cut, was that there might be
a shorter route than his own to the northern
colonies, over which his expresses
might pass speedily, and over which
wagons might come more quickly from
Pennsylvania&mdash;then the &ldquo;granary of
America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the shortest route
from the center of the colonies to the Ohio
would become the most important. The
road Braddock asked Morris to open was
completed only three miles beyond the
present town of Bedford, Pennsylvania,
when the road choppers hurried home on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>receipt of the news of Braddock&rsquo;s defeat.</p>

<p>Braddock made a death-bed prophecy; it
was that the British would do better next
time. In 1758 Pitt placed Braddock&rsquo;s unfulfilled
task on the shoulders of Brigadier-general
John Forbes, who marched to
Bedford on the new road opened by Morris;
thence he opened, along the general alignment
of the prehistoric &ldquo;Trading Path,&rdquo; a
new road to the Ohio. It was a desperate
undertaking; but Forbes completed his
campaign in November, 1758 triumphantly&mdash;at
the price of his life.</p>

<p>This road, fortified at Carlisle, Shippensburg,
Chambersburg, Loudon, Littleton,
Bedford, Ligonier, and Pittsburg became
the great military route from the Atlantic
seaboard to the trans-Allegheny empire.
By it Fort Pitt was relieved during Pontiac&rsquo;s
rebellion and the Ohio Indians were
brought to terms. Throughout the Revolutionary
War this road was the main
thoroughfare over which the western forts
received ammunition and supplies. In the
dark days of the last decade of the eighteenth
century, when the Kentucky and
Ohio pioneers were fighting for the foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>hold
they had obtained in the West, this
road played a vital part.</p>

<p>When the need for it passed, Forbes&rsquo;s
Road, too, passed away. Two great railways,
on either side, run westward following
waterways which the old road assiduously
avoided&mdash;keeping to the high ground
between them. Between these new and
fast courses of human traffic the old Glade
Road lies along the hills, and, in the dust
or in the snow, marks the course of armies
which won a way through the mountains
and made possible our westward expansion.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Old Glade Road,&rdquo; the old-time
name of the Youghiogheny division (Burd&rsquo;s
or the &ldquo;Turkey Foot&rdquo; Road) of this thoroughfare,
has been selected as the title of
this volume, as more distinctive than the
&ldquo;Pennsylvania Road,&rdquo; which would apply
to numerous highways.</p>

<h3>THE OLD TRADING PATH</h3>

<p>When, in the middle of the eighteenth
century, intelligent white men
were beginning to cross the Allegheny
Mountains and enter the Ohio basin,
one of the most practicable routes was
found to be an old trading path which ran
almost directly west from Philadelphia to
the present site of Pittsburg. According
to the Indians it was the easiest route from
the Atlantic slope through the dense laurel
wildernesses to the Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The course of
this path is best described by the route of
the old state road of Pennsylvania to Pittsburg
built in the first half-decade succeeding
the Revolutionary War. This road passed
through Shippensburg, Carlisle, Bedford,
Ligonier, and Greensburg; the Old Trading
Path passed, in general, through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
same points. Comparing this path, which
became Forbes&rsquo;s Road, with Nemacolin&rsquo;s
path which ran parallel with it, converging
on the same point on the Ohio, one might
say that the former was the overland path,
and the latter, strictly speaking, a portage
path. The Old Trading Path offered no
portage between streams, as Nemacolin&rsquo;s
path did between the Potomac and Monongahela.
It kept on higher, dryer ground
and crossed no river of importance. This
made it the easiest and surest course; in
the wintry season, when the Youghiogheny
and Monongahela and their tributaries were
out of banks, the Old Trading Path must
have been by far the safest route to the
Ohio; it kept to the high ground between
the Monongahela and Allegheny. It was
the high ground over which this path ran
that the unfortunate Braddock attempted to
reach after crossing the Youghiogheny at
Stewart&rsquo;s Crossing. The deep ravines drove
him back. There is little doubt he would
have been successful had he reached this
watershed and proceeded to Fort Duquesne
upon the Old Trading Path.</p>

<p>As is true of so many great western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
routes, so of this path&mdash;the bold Christopher
Gist was the first white man of
importance to leave reliable record of it.
In 1750 he was employed to go westward
for the Ohio Company. His outward route,
only, is of importance here.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> On Wednesday,
October 31, he departed from Colonel
Cresap&rsquo;s near Cumberland, Maryland and
proceeded &ldquo;along an old old Indian Path
N 30 E about 11 Miles.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This led him
along the foot of the Great Warrior Mountain,
through the Flintstone district of
Allegheny County, Maryland. The path
ran onward into Bedford County, Pennsylvania,
and through Warrior&rsquo;s Gap to the
Juniata River. Here, near the old settlement
Bloody Run, now Everett, the path
joined the well-worn thoroughfare running
westward familiarly known as the &ldquo;Old
Trading Path.&rdquo; Eight miles westward of
this junction, near the present site of Bedford,
a well-known trail to the Allegheny
valley left the Old Trading Path and
passed through the Indian Frank&rsquo;s Town
and northwest to the French Venango<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>&mdash;Franklin,
Pennsylvania. Leaving this on
his right, Gist pushed on west over the
Old Trading Path. &ldquo;Snow and such bad
Weather&rdquo; made his progress slow; from the
fifth to the ninth he spent between what
are now Everett in Bedford County and
Stoyestown in Somerset County.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On the
eleventh he crossed the north and east
Forks of Quemahoning&mdash;often called
&ldquo;Cowamahony&rdquo; in early records.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> On
the twelfth he &ldquo;crossed a great Laurel
Mountain&rdquo;&mdash;Laurel Hill. On the fourteenth
he &ldquo;set out N 45 W 6 M to Loylhannan
an old Indian Town on a Creek of
Ohio called Kiscominatis, then N 1 M NW 1 M
to an Indian&rsquo;s Camp on the said Creek.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The present town of Ligonier, Westmoreland
County, occupies the site of this Indian
settlement. &ldquo;Laurel-hanne, signifying the
middle stream in the Delaware tongue.
The stream here is half way between the
Juniata at Bedford and the Ohio [Pittsburg].&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Between here and the Ohio, Gist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
mentions no proper names. The path ran
northwest from the present site of Ligonier,
through Chestnut Ridge &ldquo;at the Miller&rsquo;s
Run Gap, and reached the creek again at
the Big Bottom below the present town of
Latrobe on the Pennsylvania Central Railway;
there the trail forked ... the
main trail [traveled by Gist], led directly
westward to Shannopin&rsquo;s Town, by a
course parallel with and a few miles north
of the Pennsylvania Railway.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>By this early measurement the total distance
between Carlisle to Pittsburg by the
Indian path was one hundred and ninety
miles; ninety-seven miles from Carlisle to
Raystown and ninety-three miles from
Raystown to Pittsburg.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> When it is
remembered that this was the original
Indian track totally uninfluenced by the
white man&rsquo;s attention it is interesting to
note that the great state road of Pennsylvania
from Carlisle to Pittsburg, laid out
in 1785, so nearly followed the Indian
route that its length between those points
(in 1819) was just one hundred and ninety-seven
miles&mdash;seven miles longer<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that of the prehistoric trace of Indian and
buffalo. Perhaps there is no more significant
instance of the practicability of
Indian routes in the United States than
this. The very fact that the Indian path
was not very much shorter than the first
state road shows that it was distinctively a
utilitarian course. One interested in this
significant comparison will be glad to compare
the courses of the old path and that of
the state road as given by the compass.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Other references to the Old Trading Path
are made by such traders as George Croghan
and John Harris. Croghan wrote to
Richard Peters, March 23, 1754: &ldquo;The
road we now travel ... from Laurel
Hill to Shanopens (near the forks of the
Ohio), is but 46 miles, as the road now
goes, which I suppose may be 30 odd miles
on a straight line.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In an &ldquo;Account of
the Road to Loggs Town on Allegheny
River, taken by John Harris, 1754&rdquo; this
itinerary is given:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>So much for the Old Trading Path before
the memorable year of 1755. It is signifi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>cant
that the route had already been
&ldquo;surveyed&rdquo;; Pennsylvania herself desired
a share of the Indian trade which Virginia
hoped to monopolize through her Ohio
Company, which already had storehouses
built at Wills Creek on the Cumberland
and at Redstone Old Fort on the Monongahela.
But with the beginning of hostilities
with the French, precipitated by
Washington and his Virginians in 1754,
the Indian trade was now completely at
a standstill.</p>

<p>General Braddock and his army which
was destined to march westward and capture
Fort Duquesne arrived at Alexandria,
Virginia, February 20, 1755. Already
Braddock&rsquo;s deputy quartermaster-general,
Sir John St. Clair, had passed through
Maryland and Virginia and had decided
upon the route of the army to Fort Cumberland,
the point of rendezvous. Four
days after Braddock reached Alexandria,
Governor Morris of Pennsylvania received
a letter from St. Clair asking him to &ldquo;open
a road toward the head of Youghheagang
or any other way that is nearer the French
forts,&rdquo; in order that the stores to be sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>plied
by the northern colonies might take
a shorter course than by way of the roads
then being opened through Maryland and
Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Morris immediately replied
&ldquo;... there is no Waggon Road from
Carlisle West through the Mountains but
only a Horse Path, by which the Indian
Traders used to carry their Goods and Skins
to and from the Ohio while that Trade
remained open.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Though Morris usually
made requests of the assembly in vain, the
request concerning this road was granted,
and Morris was empowered, in the middle
of March, to open a road &ldquo;through Carlisle
and Shippensburg to the Yoijogain, and to
the camp at Will Creek.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He immediately
appointed George Croghan, John
Armstrong, James Burd, William Buchannan,
and Adam Hoops to find a road to the
three forks of the Youghiogheny&mdash;or
&ldquo;Turkey Foot&rdquo; as the spot was familiarly
known on the frontier. On April 29 Burd
reported as follows to Morris: &ldquo;...
We have viewed and layed out the Roads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
leading from hence to the Yohiogain and
the camp at Will&rsquo;s Creek, and enclosed You
have the Draughts thereof.... We
have dispersed our Advertisements through
the Counties of Lancaster, York, and Cumberland,
to encourage Labourers to come
to Work, and We intend to set off to begin
to clear up on Monday first.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Thus,
slowly, the Old Trading Path was widened
into a rough roadway westward from Carlisle.
On May 26, John Armstrong wrote
Governor Morris that there were over a
hundred choppers at work.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Five days
later Burd wrote Richard Peters that there
were one hundred and fifty at work; but
he adds, ominously: &ldquo;The People are all
anxious to have arms, and if You can procure
me arms I would not trouble the
General for a cover; but if you can&rsquo;t they
will not be willing to go past Ray&rsquo;s Town
without a guard.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Little wonder: the
van of Braddock&rsquo;s army had struck westward
into the Alleghenies the day before
this was written, and already the woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
were full of spies sent out by the French,
and many massacres had been reported.
The horses and wagons which Franklin
had secured for Braddock comprised almost
his whole equipment. These had gone to
Fort Cumberland by the old &ldquo;Monocasy
Road&rdquo; and Watkins Ferry.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>On the twelfth of June Allison and Maxwell
wrote Richard Peters that &ldquo;Sideling
Hill,&rdquo; sixty-seven miles west of Carlisle,
and thirty miles east of Raystown, &ldquo;is
cut very artificially, nay more so than
We ever saw any; the first waggon that
carried a Load up it took fifteen Hundred
without ever stopping;&rdquo; there were, however,
many discouragements&mdash;&ldquo;for four
Days the Labourers had not one Glass of
Liquor!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> On June 15 William Buchannan
reported that the road was cleared to
Raystown.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But some of the wagons were
&ldquo;pretty much damnified.&rdquo; On the seventeenth
Edward Shippen wrote Morris from
Lancaster: &ldquo;I understand Mr. Burd has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
cut the Road 5 Miles beyond Ray&rsquo;s Town,
which is 90 Miles from Shippensburg.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
On the twenty-first General Braddock wrote
as follows to Governor Morris from Bear
Camp (seven miles west of Little Crossings):
&ldquo;As it is perfectly understood here in what
Part the Road making in your Province
is to communicate w<sup>th</sup> that thro&rsquo; w<sup>ch</sup> I am
now proceeding to Fort Du Quesne, I must
beg that you and Mr Peters will immediately
settle it, and send an express on
Purpose after me with the most exact
Description of it, that there may be no
Mistake in a Matter of so much Importance.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
On July 3 Morris wrote Burd,
who was in command of the working party,
concerning this request of Braddock&rsquo;s.
He takes it &ldquo;for granted ... that the
Road must pass the Turkey Foot ...
and that there cou&rsquo;d be no Road got to the
Northward.&rdquo; Under such circumstances
he affirmed that the nearest course to Braddock&rsquo;s
Road would be a straight line from
Turkey Foot (Confluence, Pennsylvania) to
the Great Crossings of the Youghiogheny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
(Smithfield, Pennsylvania). He asked Burd
to settle this point and send his decision
immediately to Braddock.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The working party on the Pennsylvania
road was attacked early in July and needed
every one of the five score men whom
Braddock had been able to spare for their
protection.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Burd replied<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> from the &ldquo;Top of the
Alleghanies&rdquo; on July 17, while still in
ignorance of Braddock&rsquo;s utter rout: &ldquo;At
present I can&rsquo;t form any Judgment where I
shall cut the General&rsquo;s Road, further than
I know our Course leads us to the Turkey
Foot, By the Information of Mr. Croghan
when we run the Road first. Mr. Croghan
assured me he wou&rsquo;d be on the Road with
me in order to pilott from the Place where
we left off blaizeing. Instead of that he
has never been here, nor is there one Man
in my Company that ever was out this Way
to the Turkey Foot, But the Party I send
will discover the Place where we shall cut
the Road and inform the General, and upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
their return I will order &rsquo;em to blaize back
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news of Braddock&rsquo;s defeat came
slowly to the cutters of this historic roadway
from central Pennsylvania to the
Youghiogheny. On Tuesday night, July
15, a messenger was sent to them from
Fort Cumberland, who arrived the night
of the day the above letter was written.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Dunbar wrote Morris from &ldquo;near ye great
Crossings&rdquo; on the sixteenth: &ldquo;I have sent
an Express to Captain Hogg, who is covering
the People cutting Your New Road, as
I can&rsquo;t think his advancing that Way safe,
to retire immediately.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Burd reported
to Morris from Shippensburg July 25, that
his party had retreated to Fort Cumberland
from the top of Allegheny Mountain July
17; &ldquo;St Clair told Me,&rdquo; he added, tentatively,
&ldquo;that I had done my Duty.&rdquo; He
had left before Dunbar&rsquo;s messenger had
arrived.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Such is the first chapter of the story of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the white man&rsquo;s occupation of the Old
Trading Path and the Old Glade Road&mdash;the
name commonly applied to the portion
which Burd opened from the main path
from where it diverged four miles west of
Bedford to the summit of Allegheny
Mountain. This branch was also known
as the &ldquo;Turkey Foot Road.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Old
Trading Path was now a white man&rsquo;s road
from Carlisle to Bedford and four miles
beyond. But the tide of war now set over
the mountains after Braddock&rsquo;s defeat,
putting an end to any improvement of the
new rough road that was opened. Yet not
all the ground gained was to be lost.
Governor Shirley, now in command, wildly
ordered Dunbar to move westward again
to retrieve Braddock&rsquo;s mistakes, but sanely
added, that, in the case of defeat &ldquo;You
are to make the most proper Disposition of
his Majesties&rsquo; Forces to cover the Frontiers
of the Provinces, particularly at the
Towns of Shippensburg and Carlisle, and
at or near a place called McDowell&rsquo;s Mill,
where the New Road to the Allegheny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Mountains begins in Pennsylvania, from
the Incursions of the Enemy until you shall
receive further orders.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Was this a hint that Braddock had been
sent by a wrong route and that his successor
would march to Fort Duquesne over the
Old Trading Path?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A BLOOD-RED FRONTIER</h3>


<p>There is no truer picture of the dark
days of 1755-56 along the frontiers
of Pennsylvania and Virginia than
that presented in the correspondence of
Washington at this time. A great burden
fell upon his young shoulders with the
failure of the campaigns of 1755. Though
far from being at fault, he suffered greatly
through the faults and failures of others.
The British army had come and had been
routed. Now, after such a victory as the
Indians had never dreamed possible, the
Virginia and Pennsylvania frontiers, five
hundred miles in length, lay helpless
before the bands of bold marauders drunk
with the blood of Braddock&rsquo;s slain.</p>

<p>The young colonel of the remnant of the
Virginia Regiment took up the difficult
task of defending the southern frontier as
readily as though a quiet, happy life on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
his rich farms was an alternative as impossible
as alluring. But perhaps a bleeding
border-land never in the world needed
a twenty-three year old lad more than
Virginia now needed her young son. A
flood-tide of murder and pillage swept over
the Alleghenies. The raids of the savages
brought the people to their senses, as the
most terrible of tales came in from the
frontier. But soon the question arose,
&ldquo;Where is the frontier?&rdquo; The great track
Braddock had opened for the conquest
of the Ohio valley became the pathway
of his conquerors, and soon Fort Cumberland,
the frontier post, was far in the
enemies&rsquo; country. The Indians soon found
Burd&rsquo;s road on the summit of the Alleghenies
and poured over it by Raystown
toward Carlisle and Shippensburg. Each
day brought the line of settlements nearer
and nearer the populous portions of Virginia
and Pennsylvania, until Winchester
became an endangered outpost and fears
were entertained for Lancaster and York.
Hundreds now who had refused the
despairing Braddock horses and wagons
saw their wives and children murdered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and their homesteads burned to the ground.</p>

<p>Whether Dunbar did right or wrong in
hurrying back to Virginia, it was a bitter
day for Virginia and Pennsylvania. When
his army hastened from the frontier, it
became the prey of the foes whose appetite
that army had whetted. Yet Shirley,
reconsidering his former scheme, ordered
Dunbar to New York. After drawing the
full fire of the French and Indians upon
Virginia and Pennsylvania, this army was
sent to New York.</p>

<p>Looking backward, with the stern years
1775-82 in mind, it is easy to see that
then, in 1755, Pennsylvania and Virginia
were to be put through a hard school for a
glorious purpose. They were to be trained
in the art of war. Of it they had known
practically nothing. They had no effective
militia. Of military ethics they had no
dream. They knew not what obedience
meant and could not understand delegated
authority. Their liberty was license or
nothing. Of the power of organization,
concentration, discipline, routine, and
method they were almost as ignorant as
their redskinned enemies. Although the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
men of New England had not been given
such great obstacles to overcome, it is
undoubtedly true that their militia was far
more adequate than anything of which
Pennsylvania or Virginia knew, at least
until 1758.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> And yet Braddock died
cursing his regulars and extolling the
colonials!</p>

<p>Washington was elected commander-in-chief
in Virginia on his own dignified
terms; the army was increased to sixteen
companies and &pound;40,000 were voted for
general defense. By October the young
commander was at Winchester, where he
faced a situation desperate and appalling.
The country-side was terror-stricken, and
few could be found even for defense;
many chose &ldquo;to die with their wives and
families.&rdquo; The few score men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
attempted to stem the tide of retreat were
almost powerless. &ldquo;No orders are obeyed,&rdquo;
Washington wrote Dinwiddie, &ldquo;but such
as a party of soldiers, or my own drawn
sword enforces.&rdquo; Such was the frenzy of
the retreat of the frontier population that
threats were made &ldquo;to blow out the
brains&rdquo; of all in authority who opposed
them. But the young commander continued
undaunted. He impressed men and
horses and wagons, and sent them hurrying
for flour and musket-balls and flints;
he compelled men to erect little fortresses
to which the people might flee.</p>

<p>Not the least of his trials&mdash;undoubtedly
the most discouraging&mdash;was the faithlessness
of the troops sent out by Governor
Dinwiddie upon the reeking frontier.
Many of them were themselves panic-stricken
and fled back with the rabble.
The whole militia r&eacute;gime was inadequate;
there was no authority of sufficient weight
vested in the commanding officers to enable
them to deal even with insolence, much
less desertion. &ldquo;I must assume the freedom,&rdquo;
Washington wrote the governor,
&ldquo;to express some surprise, that we alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
should be so tenacious of our liberty as not
to invest a power, where interest and policy
so unanswerably demand it.... Do
we not know, that every nation under the
sun finds its account therein, and that,
without it, no order or regularity can be
observed? Why then should it be expected
from us, who are all young and inexperienced,
to govern and keep up a proper
spirit of discipline without laws, when the
best and most experienced can scarcely do
it with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the winter of 1755-6 approached, the
Indian atrocities ceased and for a few
months there was quiet. But by early
spring the raids were renewed with merciless
regularity. Every day brought a new
tale of murder and pillage; and very soon
every road was filled with fugitives &ldquo;bringing
to Winchester fresh dismay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his few men this first hero of Winchester
(who by the way was at his post,
not &ldquo;twenty miles away&rdquo;) was again
straining every nerve that Virginia might
not lose the great stretch of beautiful
country west of the Blue Ridge. &ldquo;The
supplicating tears of women and moving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
petitions of the men, melt me into such
deadly sorrow, that I solemnly declare, if
I know my own mind, I could offer myself
a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy,
provided that would contribute to the
people&rsquo;s ease.&rdquo; Perhaps the vacillating
Dinwiddie threw this letter down as too
ardent a one for a military hand to pen; if
so Edward Everett has raised it aloft to
show his thrilled audiences &ldquo;the whole
man&rdquo; Washington. &ldquo;The inhabitants
are removing daily,&rdquo; he again wrote&mdash;&ldquo;...
in a short time will leave this
country as desolate as Hampshire.&rdquo; To
such a degree were the people terrified that
secret meetings were held where leaders
openly spoke of making terms with the
French and Indians by renouncing all
claims to the West&mdash;no less traitors to the
best good of the colonies than those who
celebrated over Braddock&rsquo;s defeat.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The campaign of 1756, as conducted by
Shirley, contained no hope of relief for
Pennsylvania or Virginia; &ldquo;so much am I
kept in the dark,&rdquo; Washington exclaimed,
&ldquo;that I do not know whether to prepare for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the offensive or defensive; yet what might
be absolutely necessary in the one, would be
quite useless in the other.&rdquo; He well knew
a determined stroke at Fort Duquesne, &ldquo;a
floodgate to open ruin and woe,&rdquo; was the
only hope of the southern and central
colonies. In the meantime he led a
desperately exasperating life attempting to
hold the frontier with his tatterdemalion
army by following Pennsylvania&rsquo;s example
of building a line of forts to defend the
country. There was no destitution or distress
of which he did not know; at times
he was begging for blankets to cover his
naked soldiers, and again for shoes and
shirts; there were few guns in a state of
repair and at times in days of danger hundreds
flocked to him who could neither be
fed nor armed. His life must have been
known to Lord Fairfax who wrote in the
following strain: &ldquo;Such a medley of undisciplined
militia must create you various
troubles, but having C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Commentaries
and perhaps Quintus Curtius, you have
therein read of greater fatigues, murmurings,
mutinies, and defections, than will
probably come to your share.&rdquo; The fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
is, in these days there was no officer&rsquo;s duty
with which Washington was not acquainted.
He supervised the building of forts, the
transportation of stores and guns and
ammunition, here reprimanding a coarse
mountaineer for profanity, there leading
the scouts as they threshed a mountain for
lurking Delawares; he personally hurried
off wagons to endangered outposts with
flour and powder, and then listened to and
quieted the fears of frantic women and
men.</p>

<p>Is the splendid lesson of these years
clear? By Providential dispensation these
colonies were a miniature of the America
of 1775, suddenly thrown upon its own
resources and in war. The divine hand is
not more clearly seen in our national
development than in the struggle of the
colonies between 1745 and 1763, which prepared
a nation for the hour her independence
should strike. And now it was that Washington,
Gates, Mercer, Gladwin, Lewis,
Putnam, Crawford, Gibson, Stephen, St.
Clair, and Stewart learned for themselves
and then taught their countrymen to fight;
now Washington found what it meant to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
be the commander of bare-foot armies,
already a hero of two defeats, he was yet
to play the hero in bitter, pitiful extremities,
to become a dogged believer in hopeless,
last alternatives, a burden-bearer for
hundreds of homeless ones&mdash;a people&rsquo;s
mainstay when other men were faltering.
Now, as in 1775, his task was to rouse a
people only half awake to the crisis; to
demonstrate the superiority of wisely
ordered liberty over license, and the inferiority
of personal independence compared
with a unity made strong through faithful
co&ouml;peration, and hallowed by mutual self-sacrifice.
And fortunate it was for all the
colonies that England compelled them to
learn how to carry war&rsquo;s heavy harness
now, against the day when they should be
assailed by something more disastrously
fatal to the cause of liberty than savages
fired to murder and pillage by French
brandy.</p>

<p>In all these wild days, the old path westward
from Shippensburg and Carlisle was
often crowded with fugitives fleeing from
the reeking frontier, and, quite as often,
shrouded in a cloud of dust raised by squads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of wan militia hastening westward to the
defense of the outposts. Though no officer
guarding this strategic passage-way became
endeared to his countrymen as Washington,
here heroism and devotion were displayed,
if ever on this continent. The plans of
England during these years will be
described elsewhere, but it is to our purpose
to know now that for the present she
deserted the southern provinces; that she
was &ldquo;willing to wait for the rains to wet
the powder, and rats to eat the bow-strings
of the enemy, rather than attempt to
drive them from her [southern] frontiers.&rdquo;
Until 1756 the matter of the defense of
the Pennsylvania frontier was left almost
entirely to individual initiative. But
already the road through Carlisle and Shippensburg
had been fortified. Fort Lowther
was erected in Carlisle as early as 1753.
It was an important post on the route to
Virginia, over which the wagons and horses
raised by Franklin for Braddock, were, in
part, forwarded to Fort Cumberland. Here
Governor Morris came, to be in closer touch
with Braddock, and here the news of the
defeat reached him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Fort Franklin was erected on the old road
at Shippensburg, twenty miles west of
Carlisle and thirty-six from Harris Ferry
(Harrisburg). It was built sometime previous
to Braddock&rsquo;s time but was not used
after 1756. Ten miles further on at Falling
Springs (Chambersburg) there was no
fortification in 1755, nor was there one at
Loudoun (Loudon) thirteen miles west of
that point. Two miles south of Fort Loudoun
Morris erected a deposit at McDowell&rsquo;s
Mill (Bridgeport, Franklin County) but,
though the spot was well known on the
frontier, there seems to have been no
regular fort there until 1756.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It was at
this point that the new road toward Raystown
diverged westward from the main
road running south to Virginia. This
junction was considered a strategic point
by the time of Braddock&rsquo;s defeat, as shown
by Shirley&rsquo;s order to Dunbar quoted at the
close of the last chapter.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Braddock&rsquo;s defeat the
Pennsylvania Assembly had done nothing
toward the preservation of the colony, save
ordering the road cut from Carlisle to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Youghiogheny river. They furnished not
a man for Braddock&rsquo;s army and voted not a
pound toward the expense of securing the
wagons and horses which made Braddock&rsquo;s
march possible. The stores which Governor
Morris laid in along the line of the
road, at Shippensburg and McDowell&rsquo;s
Mill, were secured and forwarded without
aid from the Assembly. Though many
Pennsylvanians served, in one way or
another, in the unfortunate expedition, the
public was divided on this issue. Some
were loyal to the Assembly and many
favored warlike measures. It has been
asserted that had not Forbes&rsquo;s Road been
built in 1758 its building would have been
postponed twenty years.</p>

<p>Passing this interesting speculation, it is
sure Braddock&rsquo;s defeat brought to Pennsylvania
a terrible and bloody awakening;
nothing can show this more strikingly than
the fact that when Braddock&rsquo;s successor
came, only three years later, the Pennsylvania
Assembly quickly supported him by
voting twenty-seven hundred men for
offensive service and appropriating half a
million dollars for war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The change was not more striking than
was the need for it. All the terrifying
scenes in Virginia were reproduced in
Pennsylvania; the savages poured through
the mountain gaps and fell with unparalleled
fury upon a hundred defenseless
settlements. Pennsylvania had not expanded
further at this time than to the
Blue Mountains. Her frontier was not,
therefore, nearly as broad as Virginia&rsquo;s,
and the frontier firing-line was not so far
removed from the populated districts. At
the same time it is probable that the
Indians from Logstown and Kittanning
could get a scalp quicker (so far as distance
was concerned) from Pennsylvania than
from Virginia&mdash;and the French paid as
much for one as for the other!</p>

<p>Late in 1756 the Pennsylvania Assembly,
now awakened to the condition of affairs
caused by their shortsighted, prejudiced
policy, took the matter of protection of the
frontier into their own hands. Failing to
furnish the ounce of prevention, they came
quickly with the pound of cure. A chain
of forts was planned which, stretching
along the barrier wall of the Blue Moun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>tains
from the Potomac to the Delaware,
should guard the more prominent gaps.
&ldquo;Sometimes the chain of defenses ran on
the south side, and frequently both sides of
the mountains were occupied, as the needs
of the population demanded. Some of
these forts consisted of the defenses previously
erected by the settlers, which were
available for the purpose, and of which the
government took possession, while others
were newly erected. Almost without
exception they were composed of a stockade
of heavy planks, inclosing a space of
ground more or less extensive, on which
were built from one to four blockhouses,
pierced with loopholes for musketry, and
occupied as quarters by the soldiers and
refugee settlers. In addition to these regular
forts it became necessary at various
points where depredations were most frequent,
to have subsidiary places of defense
and refuge, which were also garrisoned
by soldiers and which generally comprised
farmhouses, selected because of their superior
strength and convenient location,
around which the usual stockade was
thrown, or occasionally blockhouses erected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
for the purpose. The soldiers who garrisoned
these forts were provincial troops,
which almost without exception were
details from the First Battalion of the
Pennsylvania Regiment, under the command
of that brave and energetic officer,
Lt. Colonel Conrad Weiser.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The appended
map is a photograph of the original
which was made in this year, 1756&mdash;for
the forts of 1757 are not included. It is of
particular interest because it gives the
complete cordon of forts along the frontier
from the Hudson to the last fort in Virginia
which Washington was building. Among
other things this map shows clearly how
much wider were the frontiers of the southern
than those of the northern colonies.
The most westerly fort in Virginia was
fifty miles further west than Fort Duquesne.
The Appalachian range trends
southwesterly and its influence upon the
expansion of the colonies is most significant.</p>

<p>In this year, though a western campaign
on Fort Duquesne did not materialize, the
line of the old road was greatly strengthened
and a blow was struck at the Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
on the Allegheny that was timely and
effective. The former was a most important
task&mdash;of far greater importance than
was dreamed at that date. No one then
knew the part this road westward from
Carlisle was to play in our national development;
it could not have been conceived, in
1756, that this route was to be the only
fortified highway into the West&mdash;the most
important military road of equal length on
the continent throughout the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>That Fort Lowther at Carlisle was in
ruins in 1756 is shown by the following
letter written by William Trent to Richard
Peters February 15, 1756, which also gives
a realistic picture of the state of affairs
which compelled the Pennsylvania Assembly
to begin the fort-building of that
year: &ldquo;All the people had left their houses,
betwixt this and the mountain, some come
to town and others gathering into the little
forts.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> They are moving their effects from
Shippensburg; every one thinks of flying
unless the Government fall upon some
effectual method, and that immediately, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
securing the frontiers, there will not be
one inhabitant in this Valley one month
longer. There is a few of us endeavoring
to keep up the spirits of the people. We
have proposed going upon the enemy
tomorrow, but whether a number sufficient
can be got, I cannot tell; no one scarce
seems to be affected with the distress of
their neighbours and for that reason none
will stir but those that are next the enemy
and in immediate danger. A fort in this
town would have saved this part of the
country, but I doubt this town in a few
days, will be deserted, if this party [of
savages] that is out should kill any people
nigh here.&rdquo; Commissioner Young was at
Carlisle soon after, putting Fort Lowther
into proper condition; he wrote Governor
Morris: &ldquo;I have endeavored to put this
large fort in the best possible defense I can;
but I am sorry to say the people of this
town cannot be prevailed on, to do anything
for their own safety.... They
seem to be lulled into fatal security, a
strange infatuation, which seems to prevail
throughout this province.&rdquo; The fort was
not completed in July; Colonel Armstrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
wrote Morris on the twenty-third of that
month. &ldquo;The duties of the harvest field
have not permitted me to finish Carlisle
Fort with the soldiers, it should be done
otherwise, the soldiers cannot be so well
governed, and may be absent or without
the gates at the time of the greatest necessity.&rdquo;
In the same letter Colonel Armstrong&mdash;the
Washington of Pennsylvania&mdash;wrote:
&ldquo;Lyttleton, Shippensburg and Carlisle
(the two last not finished) are the only
forts now built that will in my opinion be
serviceable to the public.&rdquo; It is significant
that these three forts were on the old road
westward, showing that this route was of
utmost importance in Armstrong&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Fort Lyttleton was one of four important
forts erected, at Armstrong&rsquo;s direction, by
Governor Morris west of the Susquehanna
late in 1755 and early in 1756. It was built
&ldquo;at Sugar Cabins upon the new road&rdquo;;
wrote Morris to Shirley February 9: &ldquo;It
[Fort Lyttleton] stands upon the new road
opened by this Province towards the Ohio,
and about twenty miles from the settlements,
and I have called it Fort Lyttleton,
in honor of my friend George. This fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
will not only protect the inhabitants in that
part of the Province, but being upon a road
that within a few miles joins General Braddock&rsquo;s
road, it will prevent the march of
any regulars into the Province and at the
same time serve as an advance post or
magazine in case of an attempt to the westward.&rdquo;
The site of this fort was on land
now owned by Dr. Trout, of McConnellsburg,
Pennsylvania&mdash;about sixty feet on
the north side of the old state road.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Fort Morris at Shippensburg was building
in November 1755; &ldquo;we have one
hundred men working,&rdquo; wrote James Burd,
&ldquo;... with heart and hand every day.
The town is full of people, five or six
families in a house, in great want of arms
and ammunition; but, with what we have
we are determined to give the enemy as
warm a reception, as we can. Some of
our people have been taken prisoners, but
have made their escape, and came to us
this morning.&rdquo; There had, as noted, been
some sort of fortification here at an earlier
date, Fort Franklin. As said previously,
Fort Morris was still uncompleted July 23,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
1756. It was in Fort Franklin, undoubtedly,
that the magazine was placed during
Braddock&rsquo;s campaign. Fort McDowell, at
McDowell&rsquo;s Mill, was also erected in 1756,
being an important point at the junction
of the old road into Virginia and the new
road to Raystown. The savage onslaughts
of the Indians were felt no more severely
in any quarter than near here. At Great
Cove, in November 1755, forty-seven persons
were murdered or taken captive out of
a total population of ninety-three. The
strategic position of Fort McDowell at the
junction of the roads was emphasized by
Colonel Armstrong, who, after saying that
Forts Lyttleton, Shippensburg, and Carlisle
were the only ones that would be useful to
the public, added: &ldquo;McDowell&rsquo;s, or thereabouts,
is a necessary post; but the present
fort is not defensible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fort Loudoun was erected on the old
road in 1756, one mile east of the present
village of Loudon, Franklin County. The
spot was historic even before it was fortified,
the settlement here being one of the
oldest in that section of the state. This
point was a famous rendezvous both in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
early days when the Old Trading Path was
the main western highway, and in after
days when the path became Forbes&rsquo;s Road.
From here the pack-horse trains started
westward into the mountains loaded&mdash;two
hundred pounds to a horse&mdash;with goods
which had come this far in wagons from
Lancaster and Philadelphia. The site of
Fort Loudoun therefore marks the western
extremity of the early colonial roadways
and the eastern extremity of the &ldquo;packers&rsquo;
paths&rdquo; or trading paths which offered,
until 1758, the only route across the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Fort Loudoun was built late in
1755, after considerable debate as to its
location. Colonel Armstrong, after examining
a spot near one Barr&rsquo;s, finally determined
to locate it &ldquo;on a place in that
neighborhood, near to Parnell&rsquo;s Knob,
where one Patton lives ... as it is near
the new road; it will make the distance
from Shippensburg to Fort Lyttleton two
miles further than by McDowell&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten miles southwest of Shippensburg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Benjamin Chambers, a noted pioneer,
erected Fort Chambers at Falling Spring,
the present Chambersburg. It was a
private fort completed in 1756; by some
means the owner had secured two four-pound
cannon which he mounted in his
little fort, the roof of which he had already
covered with lead. It was feared that
Chambers&rsquo;s little fort would be captured by
the savages and the guns turned upon Shippensburg
and Carlisle. But their owner
repudiated the insinuation and even held
the guns from Colonel Armstrong, who was
armed with the governor&rsquo;s order to surrender
them. Incidentally, also, he made
good his boasts and held the fort with
equal pugnacity from the savages. Colonel
Chambers was of great assistance to General
Forbes in the days of 1758, and, as an
aged man, sent his three sons, raised in
the lead-roofed fortress with its &ldquo;Great
Guns,&rdquo; to Boston in 1775 to fight again for
the land he had helped to conquer from the
Indians in the dark days of Braddock and
Forbes. Such men as Benjamin Chambers
made Forbes&rsquo;s Road a possibility. The
state road built westward over the track of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Forbes&rsquo;s and Bouquet&rsquo;s armies is well
known in eastern Pennsylvania as the
&ldquo;Chambersburg and Pittsburg turnpike.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>These forts west of the Susquehanna
were garrisoned by the eight companies
of the second battalion of the Pennsylvania
regiment. While the work of completing
the forts not yet finished went on,
a campaign of more importance than was
realized was conceived by ex-Governor
Morris and explained to Governor Denny
and the Council. It comprised a bold
stroke by Lieutenant-colonel Armstrong at
the Indian-infested region of Kittanning on
the Allegheny. Here the Delaware Captain
Jacobs held bloody sway, having,
according to the report of an Indian spy
who had recently visited the spot, nearly
one hundred white prisoners from Virginia
and Pennsylvania captive at that point.</p>

<p>Fort Shirley was appointed the place of
rendezvous and the little campaign was
kept as secret as possible. As the map
shows, Fort Shirley (no. 23), Fort Lyttleton
(no. 24) and Shippensburg form a triangle,
the longest side of which marks the straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
line between the two latter posts. Fort
Loudoun was near this line between Fort
Lyttleton and Fort Morris at Shippensburg.
Near Fort Loudoun a branch of the old
Kittanning Path ran northwesterly by
Fort Shirley and onward to the Allegheny.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Over this track the bold band,
which rendezvoused at Fort Shirley late in
August, was to enter the Indian land. It
numbered three hundred and seven men,
almost precisely the size of Washington&rsquo;s
party which precipitated war in 1754. But
with the gloomy fate of Washington&rsquo;s band
and Braddock&rsquo;s army in mind this must have
been a thoughtful company of men that
proceeded from Fort Shirley on the next
to the last day of August 1756. Their
success was all out of proportion to their
expectation but not out of proportion to
their bravery. Within a week Kittanning
was reached, surrounded when it was darkest
before dawn, and savagely attacked in
the grey of the misty morning. The town
was utterly destroyed, some three score
savages killed and eleven prisoners rescued
and brought back over the mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
The moral effect of this dash toward the
Allegheny was of exceeding benefit to the
whole frontier, and Armstrong&mdash;always
feared by the Indians&mdash;became their
especial <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>. The expedition, having
been made from lethargic Pennsylvania,
had a wholesome effect upon all the other
colonies and did much to cement them into
the common league which accomplished
much before two years had passed. Armstrong,
as one of the builders of the new
road through Raystown, as efficient officer
in the work of fortifying this route, and
now as leader of an offensive stroke at once
daring and successful, was slowly being
fitted for more useful and more important
duties when the flower of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
frontier should be thrown across the Alleghenies
upon Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>This officer&rsquo;s opinion, already quoted,
that the only forts worth the candle west
of the Susquehanna were the three or four
which fortified the main route westward
from Carlisle to Raystown, appears to have
met the approval of those in authority by
1757; on April 10, Governor Denny wrote
to the Proprietaries: &ldquo;Four Forts only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
were to remain over Susquehannah, viz.,
Lyttleton, Loudoun, Shippensburg, and
Carlisle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> If this is considered a backward
step it must also be considered as a
concentration of energy in a most telling
manner. If the frontier from the Susquehanna
to the Maryland line could not be
held at every point the decision seems to
have been that the line of the old road
must be secured at all costs, whereupon
all the public forts were abandoned save
the four which guarded this western highway.
But the decision meant more than
this. It was in fact an offensive measure.
Instead of holding a line of forts at the
mountain gaps as a shield to the settlements,
the line of the roadway westward
was to be protected and even prolonged&mdash;a
bristling sword-point stretching over the
Alleghenies into the very heart of the
French and Indian region. This is proved
by the building of a new fort yet further
west than Lyttleton&mdash;at Raystown, near
the point where Burd&rsquo;s road, cut in 1755
toward the Youghiogheny, left the Old
Trading Path. This significant undertak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ing
was evidently on the tapis early in the
winter. On February 22, Armstrong wrote
Burd: &ldquo;This is all that can possibly be
done, before the grass grows and proper
numbers unite, except it is agreed to
fortify Raystown, of which I, yet, know
nothing.&rdquo; On the fifth of May he addressed
a letter to the governor in which he said:
&ldquo;... prompts me to propose to your
Honour what I have long ago suggested, to
the late Governor and gentlemen commissioners,
that is the building a fort at Raystown
without which the King&rsquo;s business
and the country&rsquo;s safety can never be
effected to the westward.... &rsquo;Tis true
this service will require upwards of five
hundred men, as no doubt they will be
attacked if any power be at Fort Duquesne,
because this will be a visible, large
and direct stride to that place.&rdquo; Thus it is
clear that every step westward on the new-cut
roadway from Fort Lyttleton toward
Raystown was a step toward Fort Duquesne,
and every fortification built on this track
was a &ldquo;visible, large and direct&rdquo; stroke at
the power of France on the Ohio. A fort
was erected at Raystown within the year.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE CAMPAIGNS OF 1758</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Between the French and the earthquakes,&rdquo;
wrote Horace Walpole in
1758 to Mr. Conway, &ldquo;you have no
notion how good we have grown; nobody
makes a suit of clothes now but of sackcloth
turned up with ashes.&rdquo; The years 1756
and 1757 were crowded with disappointments.
With the miscarriage of the three
campaigns of 1755, Governor Shirley
became the successor of the forgotten Braddock
and assembled a council of war at
New York composed of Governors Shirley,
Hardy, Sharpe, Morris, and Fitch, Colonels
Dunbar and Schuyler, Majors Craven and
Rutherford, and Sir John St. Clair. As
though in very mockery, the king&rsquo;s instructions
to the betrayed and sacrificed Braddock
were read to the council, after which
General Shirley announced a scheme for
campaigns to be conducted during the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
year. The new &ldquo;generalissimo&rdquo; proposed
four campaigns: one army of five thousand
men was to assemble at Oswego, four thousand
of whom were to be sent to destroy,
first, Fort Frontenac, then Forts Niagara,
Presque Isle, La B&#339;uf, and Detroit; a
second army of three thousand provincials
was to march over Braddock&rsquo;s Road against
Fort Duquesne; an army of one thousand
men was to advance to Crown Point on
Lake Champlain and erect a fort there; a
fourth army of two thousand men was to
&ldquo;carry fire and sword&rdquo; up the Kennebec
River, across the portage, and down Rivi&egrave;re
Chaudi&egrave;re to its mouth near Quebec. The
Council agreed, as councils will, to all this
Quixotic program; insisting, however, that
ten thousand men should be sent to Crown
Point and six thousand to Oswego.</p>

<p>In spite of Shirley&rsquo;s earnestness things
moved very slowly, and the bickering
between governors and assemblies and the
jealousy of men out of power of those in
power retarded every movement. The
deadlock in Pennsylvania resulted in the
abandonment of that province and Virginia
so far as offensive measures were concerned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and the two governors busied themselves
in fortifying their smoking frontiers, as
described above. And finally the northern
campaigns toward the lakes came to a sudden
stand when General Shirley was superseded
in his command by Lord Loudoun
who, lacking the sense to forward Shirley&rsquo;s
plans, officiously altered them completely
at a time when everything depended on
quick and concerted action. As a result,
Loudoun moved northward at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>

<p>It seemed as though affairs in America
were momentarily paralyzed by the shock
of the tremendous conflict now opened on
the continent. On the eighteenth of May
England had declared war on France and
twenty-two days later France responded,
and the most terrible conflict of the eighteenth
century opened, in which the great
Frederick eventually humbled, with England&rsquo;s
help, the three empresses whose
hatred he had drawn upon himself. But
while Louis sent an army of one hundred
thousand against Frederick, he had yet
twelve thousand to hurry over to New
France to make good the successes of 1755.
These sailed under that best and bravest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Frenchmen since the days of Champlain,
Montcalm, on the third of April. In three
months Montcalm had swept down Lake
Champlain to Fort Ticonderoga. Then, as
if to make sport of his antagonist&mdash;Loudoun,
who had abandoned Shirley&rsquo;s Oswego
scheme&mdash;Montcalm returned to Montreal,
hurried with three thousand soldiers down
the St. Lawrence and across to Oswego,
which surrendered at once with its twelve
hundred defenders. The outwitted Loudoun
crawled slowly up to Lake George;
the winter of 1756-57 came on, and the two
commanders glared at each other across the
narrow space of snow and ice that separated
them. The two important campaigns
planned by Shirley were utter failures, and
the westward campaign against Fort Duquesne
was not even attempted. The
French were strengthening everywhere.
&ldquo;Whoever is in or whoever is out,&rdquo;
exclaimed Chesterfield, &ldquo;I am sure we
are undone both at home and abroad....
We are no longer a nation.&rdquo; But one of
Shirley&rsquo;s <i>coups</i> had succeeded; Winslow
captured Beaus&eacute;jour. In the west Armstrong
had razed the Indian town of Kittan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>ning
on the Allegheny. On the other
hand these minor successes were far overbalanced
by the destruction of Oswego and
Fort Bull, between the Mohawk and Lake
Oneida, and the menacing position Montcalm
had assumed with the strengthening
of Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and Frontenac.</p>

<p>Pitt, a fine example of a man too powerful
to hold office with peace, was forced
into the premiership again near the end of
this black year of 1756. Parliament
refused to support him, the Duke of Cumberland,
captain-general of the army,
opposed him, and the king hated him; early
in April 1757 he was dismissed. England
had found her man but the pigmies in
power shrank from acknowledging him.
With that sublime confidence which once
or twice in a century betokens latent genius,
Pitt exclaimed: &ldquo;I am sure I can save this
country, and that nobody else can.&rdquo; Meantime
Chesterfield was sighing: &ldquo;I never
saw so dreadful a time.&rdquo; The year of 1757
dragged on as gloomily as its predecessor.
Montcalm, master of the situation, pushed
southward upon Fort William Henry on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Lake George, and General Webb at Fort
Edward. Loudoun abandoned the scene
and went gallantly sailing with the fleet
against Louisbourg. Fort William Henry
surrendered and Montcalm spread terror to
Albany and New York. Had he pressed
his advantage it is questionable if he could
not have occupied the whole Hudson Valley.
Why he did not could have been
explained better in Quebec than in New
York. It was ever the foe behind Montcalm
that was his worst enemy, and which
eventually compassed his ruin.</p>

<p>If official jealousies were now the bane
of New France, incapacity until now had
handicapped her enemies. When Pitt was
forced out of office in April, England was
&ldquo;left without a government.&rdquo; &ldquo;England
has been long in labor,&rdquo; said the Prussian
Frederick, &ldquo;and at last she has brought
forth a man.&rdquo; Her hour was long delayed,
but early in 1758 Pitt was again made Secretary
of State with old Newcastle First
Lord of the Treasury. &ldquo;It was a partnership
of magpie and eagle. The dirty work
of government, intrigue, bribery, and all
the patronage that did not affect the war,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
fell to the share of the old politician. If
Pitt could appoint generals, admirals, and
ambassadors, Newcastle was welcome to
the rest. &lsquo;I will borrow the Duke&rsquo;s majorities
to carry on the government,&rsquo; said
the new secretary.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Seldom indeed has the elevation of one
man to power produced such almost instantaneous
results as did the elevation of Pitt.
The desperateness of England&rsquo;s condition
undoubtedly intensified, by contrast, the
successes which came when he assumed
full power. England had been fighting,
not France and her allies, but the stars; all
the bravery and sturdiness of her soldiers
and sailors could not counteract the ignorance
and incapacity of those who had
heretofore commanded them. Now, capacity
and ability were in league; like an
electric shock the realization of this significant
union passed from man to man.
The people felt it, and the army and navy;
the political pigmies about the throne felt
it, as well as the king. Pitt, vain as any
genius, asked for the latter&rsquo;s confidence;
the reply was &ldquo;deserve it and you shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
have it&rdquo;&mdash;and a Hanoverian king of England
kept his word. &ldquo;I shall now have no
more peace,&rdquo; he had sighed when Pelham
died; and had not the reins of power soon
passed into the hands of Pitt it is doubtful
if he ever could have had peace with honor.
It was the skilful surgeon&rsquo;s knife that
England needed, and no time for men who
feared the sight of blood; the &ldquo;Great Commoner&rdquo;
proved the skilful surgeon and at
once gave England a motto Pelham never
knew: &ldquo;Neither fleet nor army should eat
the bread of the nation in idleness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitt at once displayed a prime qualification
for his post of honor by choosing with
unfailing discernment men who should lead
both fleets and armies from idleness into
action. His American campaign of 1758
embraced three decisive movements, an
attack on Louisbourg&mdash;stepping-stone to
Quebec&mdash;an invasion upon Montcalm on
Lake Champlain, and an expedition to Fort
Duquesne. For these three movements he
chose two of the three leaders. The two
he chose completed their assignments with
utmost courage and success. The third,
Abercrombie, whom Pitt could not prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
succeeding the incompetent Loudoun&mdash;met
with defeat. As if to reaffirm his sagacity,
Ferdinand of Brunswick, whom Pitt sent
to Frederick the Great in the place of the
disgraced Duke of Cumberland, was also
signally victorious over the foes who had
compelled the king&rsquo;s brother, the year
before, to sign a convention in which he
promised to disband his army.</p>

<p>Admiral Boscawen set Amherst down
before Louisbourg with fourteen thousand
men at the beginning of June, young Wolfe
leading the army up from the boats over
crags which the French had left unguarded
because they were, seemingly, inaccessible.
At the same time Abercrombie was gathering
his army, of equal strength, at the
head of Lake George, preparatory to proceeding
northward upon Fort Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>The command, of the Fort Duquesne
campaign was given by Pitt to Brigadier
John Forbes, a Scot, ten years younger
than his century. Of Forbes little seems
to be known save that he began life as a
medical student; abandoning his profession
for that of arms he made a brave and good
officer. That Pitt chose him to retrieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the dead Braddock&rsquo;s mistakes speaks loudly
of his commanding abilities; the numerous
quotations from his correspondence given
elsewhere in this monograph will present
a clearer picture of this almost unknown
hero than has ever yet been drawn.
&ldquo;Though a well-bred man of the world,&rdquo;
writes Parkman, &ldquo;his tastes were simple;
he detested ceremony, and dealt frankly
and plainly with the colonists, who both
respected and liked him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The correspondence
between Forbes and his chief
assistant, Lieutenant-colonel Henry Bouquet,
a Swiss, commanding the regiment
of Royal Americans, is convincing proof of
the democratic plainness and whole-hearted
earnestness of Braddock&rsquo;s successor.</p>

<p>The condition of the frontiers of Virginia
and Pennsylvania during the years succeeding
Braddock&rsquo;s defeat has been previously
reviewed, and the greatness of the task
now thrown upon General Forbes&rsquo;s shoulders
can be readily conceived. Yet there
was much in his favor; the colonies were
quite aroused to the danger. Pennsylvania
and Virginia were at last ready to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
shoulder to shoulder in an attempt to drive
the French from the Ohio. Pennsylvania
promised Forbes twenty-seven hundred
men; sixteen hundred were to come
from Virginia and other of the southern
provinces. Twelve hundred Highlanders
from Montgomery&rsquo;s regiment were given
Forbes, also the Royal American regiment,
made up largely of Pennsylvania Germans
and officered by men brought for the purpose
from Europe. The force, when at
last gathered together, amounted to
between six and seven thousand men.
The very proportions of this army were its
principal menace. No one believed that
Fort Duquesne, far away in the forests
beyond the mountains, could hold out
against this formidable array. That the
French, now being attacked simultaneously
in the east and in the north, could send
re&euml;nforcements to the Ohio was no more
likely. But there still lay the Alleghenies,
their crags and gorges. Could this
large body of troops cross them and take
provisions sufficient to support men and
horses? As with Braddock, so now with
Forbes, it was the mere physical feat of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
throwing an army three hundred miles
into the forests that was the crucial problem.
Fort Duquesne could have been
captured with half of Forbes&rsquo;s army; Wolfe
had hardly more than that at Quebec in
the year succeeding. If Forbes could
move this army, or any considerable fraction
of it, across the mountains, there was
no reasonable doubt of his success.</p>

<p>Forbes was much more delayed in getting
his expedition off than was either of
his two colleagues, Abercrombie and
Amherst. Little dreaming that it would
not be until the middle of June that his
stores would arrive from England, Forbes
had in March settled upon Conococheague
(Williamsport, Maryland) as a convenient
point of rendezvous for his army.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In this
he acted upon the advice of his quartermaster-general,
Sir John St. Clair, who was
sent forward to examine routes and provide
forage, but for whom, however, Forbes had
little respect. Some time later St. Clair
urged Forbes to alter this plan and make
the new outpost on Burd&rsquo;s Road toward the
Youghiogheny, Raystown, the point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
rendezvous. The difficulty of the route
from Conococheague to Fort Cumberland
undoubtedly induced St. Clair to advise this
change of base; later Governor Sharpe had
a road cut from Fort Frederick to Fort
Cumberland, but that was not until late in
June. Following St. Clair&rsquo;s advice, Forbes
changed his original plan and Raystown
(Bedford, Pennsylvania) became the base of
supplies and point of rendezvous. On the
twenty-third of April Colonel Bouquet,
commanding the Royal Americans, wrote
Forbes of his arrival at New York and in
less than a month this exceedingly efficient
officer was on his way over the old road
westward through Shippensburg and Carlisle.
He was at Lancaster May 20, and
wrote Forbes: &ldquo;I arrived here this morning,
and found Mr Young waiting for
money to clear Armstrong&rsquo;s Path the
Commissioners having disappointed him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
On the twenty-second he wrote again outlining
the route and stages on the road to
Raystown:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>General Forbes reached Philadelphia by
the middle of April but found himself as
yet without an army. The raising of the
provincials progressed slowly; his Highlanders
were not yet arrived from South
Carolina; his stores and ammunition had
not come from England. However, on
May 20, he wrote Bouquet giving orders
concerning the formation of magazines and
ordered him to contract for one hundred
and twenty wagons to transport provisions
&ldquo;backwards to Rays town,&rdquo; and to select
at that point a site for a fort. He added:
&ldquo;By all means have the road reconnoitred
from Rays town to the Yohageny&rdquo;&mdash;the
road Burd had completed to the summit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Allegheny Mountain in 1755. It is plain
that Forbes intended, at this time, to
march to Fort Cumberland by way of
Carlisle and Bedford, and go on to Fort
Duquesne over Braddock&rsquo;s Road. In this
case he much needed Burd&rsquo;s road to the
Youghiogheny&mdash;for the same reasons that
Braddock did. There is no evidence that
Forbes conceived the plan of using a new
road westward from Raystown until he and
Bouquet came to realize that, with that
point as a rendezvous, the Fort Cumberland
route would necessitate a long detour from
a direct line toward Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>Bouquet pushed on westward. He left
Fort Lowther, at Carlisle, June 8, and was
writing Forbes from Fort Loudoun on the
eleventh. On the twenty-second he reached
the Juniata and wrote Forbes on the twenty-eighth
from his &ldquo;Camp near Raes
Town,&rdquo; which now became the rendezvous
of the summer&rsquo;s campaign. Here Fort
Bedford was built, making the most westernly
fort in the chain of fortresses built
through central Pennsylvania. It was one
of the leading features of General Forbes&rsquo;s
plan to extend this chain of forts all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
way to the Ohio. &ldquo;It was absolutely
necessary,&rdquo; he wrote to Pitt, explaining
this feature of his campaign, &ldquo;that I should
take precautions by having posts along my
route, which I have done from a project
that I took from Turpin&rsquo;s Essay, <i>Sur la
Guerre</i>. Last chapter 4<sup>th</sup> Book, Intitled
<i>Principe sur lequel on peut &eacute;tablir un projet de
Campagne</i>, if you take the trouble of Looking
into this Book, you will see the General
principles upon which I have proceeded.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The Highlanders did not arrive from
South Carolina until the seventh of June,
and the army stores and artillery did not
arrive from England until the fourteenth.
The work of raising the provincial troops
was not forwarded with any greater
despatch. In general terms Forbes did not
get fairly started from the seaboard until
three weeks later than Braddock had left
Fort Cumberland. Thus, though personally
blameless, Forbes began his campaign
under an almost fatal handicap. And, with
this army converging from many points
upon Fort Bedford, arose the vital question
of routes to be pursued.</p>

<h3>THE OLD OR A NEW ROAD?</h3>


<p>So many are the versions of the story of
the building of Forbes&rsquo;s Road through
Pennsylvania that it was with utmost
interest that the present writer took up the
task of examining the only sources of
reliable information: the correspondence
of General Forbes, Colonel Bouquet, and
Sir John St. Clair, as preserved in the Bouquet
Papers at the British Museum, and at
the British Public Records Office. While
these letters were supplemented by frequent
personal interviews which have never been
recorded, yet the testimony given by them
is overwhelming that, until the very last,
both men, Forbes and Bouquet, were quite
undecided what route to Fort Duquesne
was most practicable; both were open to
conviction, and were equally disinterested
parties, thinking only of the good of the
cause to which both soon gave their lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
No one can read this voluminous correspondence
and believe for one moment that
General Forbes was prejudiced in favor
of a Pennsylvania route by Pennsylvania
intriguers, as has been frequently
asserted;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> nor that the brave Swiss Bouquet
was at any time determined to guide the
army whose van he bravely led by any
but the most expeditious and practicable
thoroughfare. That both men knew of the
bitter factional fight which was waging, this
correspondence makes very clear; that both
were made doubly proof against factional
arguments, because of this knowledge, is
equally plain.</p>

<p>Before entering upon a consideration of
the Forbes-Bouquet-St. Clair correspondence,
it must be always remembered that
General Forbes had originally planned to
make the campaign by the old Braddock
Road from Virginia and had issued orders
for the assembling of both provincial and
regular troops at &ldquo;Conegochieque&rdquo; (Conococheague),
on the road built by Governor
Sharpe from Alexandria to Fort Frederick
in 1754, over which Dunbar&rsquo;s column<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
marched.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It was undoubtedly his purpose
to march south from Philadelphia over the
old Monoccasy road to the Potomac and
then westward over the Braddock routes
which converged upon Fort Cumberland.
From there the main track of Braddock&rsquo;s
army offered an open way toward Fort
Duquesne. As previously suggested it was
the advice of Sir John St. Clair, his quartermaster-general,
that influenced Forbes
to alter his plan and march straight westward
from Philadelphia toward Lancaster
and the Pennsylvania frontier. Whatever
may have induced St. Clair to give this
advice, it is sure he had learned some lessons
from the disastrous campaign of 1755
when he led Braddock through a country
quite devoid of carriages, horses, and
produce; Pennsylvania, on the other hand,
was the granary of America;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and, if a
road was lacking, horses and wagons were
not, and it was better to lack what could be
provided than to lack that which could not
possibly be obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 20, Forbes wrote Bouquet from
Philadelphia that it was time the magazines
were being formed. One week later (May
21), Sir John St. Clair wrote Bouquet from
Winchester: &ldquo;Governor Sharpe has been
here with me and is returned to Frederick
Town in Maryland.&rdquo; It would seem that
Sir John&rsquo;s change of mind concerning the
advisability of Forbes opening a new route
westward dated from Governor Sharpe&rsquo;s
visit; for, on the day following (May 28),
he writes Bouquet: &ldquo;I am not anxious
about the cutting the Road to Rays Town
from Fort Cumberland, it may be done in
4 days, or in 2, if the two Ends are gone
upon at the same time; but I am afraid you
will have a deal of work from Fort Loudon
to Rays Town, which I am afraid will be
Troublesome.&rdquo; On the cover of this letter
Bouquet made the following memorandum:
&ldquo;The Officer Commanding the Virginia
Troops, soon to March into Pennsylvania,
is to take Directions from Henry Pollan
living upon the Temporary line, or in his
absence, from any Sensible person about
his House, for the nearest and best Waggon
Road From said Pollans or the Widow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
McGaws to Fort Loudon, to which place
the Troops are to March, Shippensburg
being much out of the Way.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Bouquet reached Carlisle on the twenty-fourth
of May, and wrote Forbes as follows
on the day after: &ldquo;I shall order Washington&rsquo;s
Regiment to Fort Cumberland and as
soon as we take post at Reas Town 300 of
them must cut the Road along the Path
from Fort Cumberland to Reas Town and
join us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The evident plan of Sir John St. Clair to
divert Bouquet from the route he had
originally outlined is disclosed further in a
letter written from Winchester on May 31,
in which he says: &ldquo;I cannot send Col<sup>o</sup>
Byrd to you as all the Cherokees have
resolved never more to go to Pennsylvania,
on account of the Soldiers of fort Loudon,
taking up arms against them, by Cap<sup>t</sup>
Trent&rsquo;s Instigation.&rdquo; Under the same
date, however, Bouquet wrote St. Clair and
in the letter gave the order which he had
preserved in form of a memorandum on the
back of St. Clair&rsquo;s letter of May 28. Sir
John, however, became more and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
insistent that the Virginia and Maryland
routes should be employed; on June 6 he
wrote Bouquet that &ldquo;the Pattomack has as
much water in it as the Po at Cremona,&rdquo;
intending to show how useful the stream
would be for transporting army stores to
Fort Cumberland. On June 9&mdash;when
Washington arrived at Winchester&mdash;St.
Clair wrote Bouquet: &ldquo;I send you this by
John Walker who is the best Woodsman I
ever knew, he will be usefull in reconnoitering
the road to be cut on the other Side
of the Mountain, but do not attempt it too
far to the Right.&rdquo; In this letter St. Clair
again reiterates the threat that the Cherokees
will not go into Pennsylvania. And
in a postscript, written in French, he adds
a parting shot: &ldquo;I think you will have
some trouble to find a road from the mountain
to the great falls of the Yougheogany.&rdquo;
On June 11 St. Clair again wrote: &ldquo;I had
great dependence on John Walker the
Guide for finding the Road from the Allegheny
Ridge to the great Crossing, I
detained him the other day, on purpose, to
know if he wou&rsquo;d attempt to find it. The
answer that he made me, was, that he knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that Country very well, having hunted
there many years, that the Hills run across
the line the Road ought to go and are very
steep: That he was sent by Col<sup>o</sup> Dunbar,
from the great Crossing, to acquaint Col<sup>o</sup>
Burd, of the defeat of the Army, and that
the year after he was taken prisoner by the
Shanese, and carried [over] that Road, to
the french fort; and that the Shanese (who
he was acquainted with and speaks their
Language) told him, that was the best
way to get out of these Mountains and
Laurell Thicketts. On the whole he says
that the Road may be made, with a great
deal of labor, &amp; time, but that it must be
reconoiter&rsquo;d, when the leaves are off the
Trees; being impossible to do it at this
season. Considering all these Circumstances
and the Season of the Year advancing
so fast, and the Small Number of
Indians we have left, I must send you my
opinion (which always was that if I was to
carry a Convoy from Lancaster to fort
Cumberland I would pass by, or near Reas
Town). That we have not time to reconoitre
the Road in question, and open it,
without taking up more time than we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to spare, and which wou&rsquo;d give the french
and Indians too favorable an opportunity
of attacking on that laborious Work. I
think it will be more eligible to fall down on
fort Cumberland, and get on from thence
to the great Crossing, after making a Block
house, at the little meadows. This will
advance us 40 miles from fort Cumberland,
and a deposite may be made at that place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one can read this strange letter without
realizing Bouquet&rsquo;s unhappy situation:
a vacillating know-nothing for quartermaster-general,
and a commander-in-chief
detained from coming to the front. Bouquet
wrote to Forbes, who answered that
the course of the proposed new road should
be examined before that route was abandoned.
&ldquo;I have yours of the 14<sup>th</sup>,&rdquo; wrote
Forbes on June 19, &ldquo;from Fort Loudon
and I am sorry that you are obliged to
change our Route, and shall be glad to find
the road proposed by Gov<sup>r</sup> Sharp practicable,
in which case I should think it ought
to be sett about immediately.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>... I
suppose you will reconnoitre the road across
the Allegany mountains from Reas town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and if found unpracticable, that the Fort
Cumberland Garrison should open the old
road<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> forward towards the Crossing of the
Yohagani.... I find we must take nothing
by report in this country, for there are
many who have their own designs in representing
things, so I am glad you have
proceeded to Reas town, where you will
be able to judge of the roads and act
accordingly.... Let there be no stops
put to the roads as that is our principall
care at present.&rdquo; No one can believe that
the author of this letter was the blindly
prejudiced man some have painted him.</p>

<p>Bouquet was, however, not to be contented
with an examination of one route
westward; his scouts were out in three
directions: on Braddock&rsquo;s Road, on the
Old Trading Path running westward from
Raystown (now Bedford), and also on the
upper path toward the Allegheny by way
of the Indian Frank&rsquo;s Town. In all this
Forbes seconded him as shown by his letter
of June 27: &ldquo;I approve much of your trying
to pass the Laurel Hill leaving the
Yohageny to the left, as also of knowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
what can be done by the path from Franks
town or even from the head of the Susquehannah,
For I have all along had in view
to have partys, to fall upon their Settlements
about Venango and there abouts
while we are pushing forward our principale
Design.&rdquo; In the meantime old Sir John
kept up his current of objections, so wretchedly
ill-timed; he wrote thus from Carlisle
June 30: &ldquo;I shall be glad you may find a
Waggon Road leaving the Yougheagany
on the left, it is what I never cou&rsquo;d find, I
think the Experiment is dangerous at present
and going on an uncertainty when by
falling down upon fort Cumberland, we
have our Road opened; should [the wagon
road] be made use of, then the Collums of
our army would be too far assunder.&rdquo; St.
Clair had been pushing the opening of the
road from Fort Frederick to Fort Cumberland
in the expectation that the army would
consequently &ldquo;fall down&rdquo; to the more
southernly westward road even before
reaching Fort Cumberland. Three days
previous to the last letter quoted he wrote
Bouquet: &ldquo;I have this morning [June 27]
received the report that the road from fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Frederick to Fort Cumberland is practicable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bouquet evidently laid the sum and substance
of St. Clair&rsquo;s letters before General
Forbes who, on July 6, delivered himself in
reply as follows: &ldquo;Sir John St. Clair was
the person who first advised me to go by
Raes town, why he has altered his sentiments
I do not know, or to what purpose
make the road from Fort Frederick to Cumberland,
as most certainly we shall now all
go by Raes town, but I am afraid that Sir
John is led by passions, he says he knows
very well that we shall not find a road from
Raes town across the Allegany, and that to
go by Raes town to F. Cumberland is a
great way about, but this he ought to have
said two months ago or hold his peace now.
Pray examine the Country tother side of
the Allegany particularly the Laurell Ridge
that he says its impossible we can pass
without going into Braddock&rsquo;s old road.
What his views are in those suggestions I
know not, but I should be sorry to be
obliged to alter ones schemes so late in the
day, particularly as it was S<sup>ir</sup> Johns proper
business to have forseen and to have fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>told
all this. Who to the Contrary was
the first adviser. Let the road to Fort
Cumberland from Raes town be finished
with all Diligence because if we must go
by Fort Cumberland it must be through
Raes town as it is now too late to make
use of the road by Fort Frederick and I
fancy you will agree that ... there is
no time to be lost.&rdquo; General Forbes wrote
an interesting letter to Pitt under the date
of July 10. Speaking of Raystown he
writes: &ldquo;The place having its name from
one Rae, who designed to have made
a plantation there several years ago.&rdquo;
Speaking of the country he observes:
&ldquo;Being an immense Forest of 240 miles in
Extent, intersected by several ranges of
mountains, impenetrable almost to any
thing human save the Indians (if they be
allowed the appelation) who have foot
paths or tracks through those desarts, by the
help of which, we make our roads....
I am in hopes of finding a better way over
the Alleganey Mountain, than that from
fort Cumberland which General Braddock
took. If so I shall shorten both my march,
and my labor of the road about 40 miles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
which is a great consideration. For were
I to pursue M<sup>r</sup> Braddock&rsquo;s route, I should
save but little labour, as that road is now
a brush wood, by the sprouts from the old
stumps, which must be cut down and made
proper for Carriages as well as any other
passage that we must attempt.&rdquo; Yet his
letter to Bouquet on the day after, July 11,
says that Forbes was not stickling for the
new road: &ldquo;I shall hurry up the troops,
directly,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;so pray see for a road
across the Alligeny or by Fort Cumberland,
which Garrison may if necessary be
clearing Braddocks old road.&rdquo; However,
lest he be put under the necessity of taking
the longer route, he wrote again to Bouquet
by James Grant: &ldquo;that the Road over the
Allegany may be reconnoitred, for he
(Forbes) is unwilling to be put under the
necessity of making any Detour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On July 14 General Forbes wrote Bouquet
from Carlisle: &ldquo;I ... have all
along thought the road from F. Frederick
to Cumberland superfluous, if we could have
done without it, which I am glad to understand
we can do by Raes town. It would
have been double pleasure if from thence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
we could have got a good road across the
Laurell hill, But by Cap<sup>t</sup> Wards journal
I begin to fear it will be difficult, altho I
would have you continue to make further
tryalls, for I should be very sorry to pass
by Fort Cumberland. I am sensible that
some foolish people have made partys to
drive us into that road, as well as into the
road by Fort Frederick, but as I utterly
detest all partys and views in military
operations, so you may very well guess,
how and what arguments I have had with
S<sup>ir</sup> John St Clair upon that subject. But I
expect Governor Sharp here this night
when I shall know more of this same road.
I hope your second detachment across the
Allegeny have been able to ascertain what
route we must take, and that consequently
you are sett about clearing of it.... I
have sent up Major Armstrong with one
Demming an old Indian trader who has
been many a time upon the road from Raes
town to Fort duquesne, he says there is no
Difficulty in the road across the Laurell
Hill and that He leaves the Yohageny all
the way upon his left hand about 8 miles,
and that it is only 40 miles from the Lau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>rell
Hill to Fort duquesne, along the top of
the Chestnut ridge.... As I presume
you may want Forage, and as S<sup>ir</sup> John has
confessed that he had provided none but
at Fort Cumberland (I suppose on purpose
to drive me into that road, for what purpose
I know not) If you therefore think it
necessary, send Waggons to Fort Cumberland
for part of it.... Let me hear
immediately your resolution about the
road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Bouquet replied that he had sent
orders to have Braddock&rsquo;s Road reconnoitred
and cleared; &ldquo;at all events it may
serve to deceive the Enemy.&rdquo; He was
daily in expectation of news from his
exploring parties on Laurel Hill and promised
Forbes to forward their report as soon
as he received it.</p>

<p>Washington had now reached Fort Cumberland
and was soon in correspondence
with Bouquet at Raystown thirty-four miles
to the northward. July 16 he wrote: &ldquo;I
shall direct the officer, that marches out, to
take particular pains in reconnoitring General
Braddock&rsquo;s road, though I have had
repeated information, that it only wants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
such small repairs, as could with ease be
made as fast as the army would march.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
On the twenty-first he wrote: &ldquo;The bridge
is finished at this place, and tomorrow
Major Peachey, with three hundred men,
will proceed to open General Braddock&rsquo;s
road. I shall direct them to go to George&rsquo;s
Creek, ten miles in advance. By that time
I may possibly hear from you ... for it
will be needless to open a road, of which no
use will be made afterwards.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Thus it
is clear that, as late as July 20, Washington
at Fort Cumberland, Bouquet at Raystown,
and Forbes at Carlisle were all in
doubt as to the army&rsquo;s route.</p>

<p>On July 21 Bouquet wrote General
Forbes: &ldquo;I waited for the return of
Captain Ward before replying [to Forbes&rsquo;s
letters of the 14th and 17th inst]. He
arrived yesterday evening, his journal
being so vague and confused that I could
not understand anything from it. Captain
Gordon is making an extract from it which
I send with this. They are convinced that
a waggon road could be made across Lau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>rell
Hill, not so bad as that from Fort
Littleton to this place, &amp; that there is
water and grass all the way, but little
forage between the two mountains. The
slope of the Alleghany is the worst, the
country between that and Laurell Hill is
passable, and this last mountain, (of which
they have made a sample&mdash;) is very easy
to cross: all the guides &amp; officers who were
on the Ohio agree that from Lawrell Hill
onwards there are no further difficulties;
it is a chain of hills easy to cross. They
have thought it impracticable to continue
the road cut by Colonel Burd to join the
Braddock road, except by following the
whole length of Lawrell Hill, which would
make the road longer than if taken through
Cumberland; the rest of the country is
rendered impassable by marshes, &amp;c. The
pack horses have just arrived. We must
give them a day&rsquo;s rest, &amp; on the day after
tomorrow Major Armstrong will set out
with a party of 100 volunteers to mark out
the road, and will send me a man every
day (or every two days) to inform me of his
progress &amp; observations. There is no spot
suitable for the making of a dep&ocirc;t until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
one comes to the foot of the other slope of
Lawrell Hill, which may be about 45 miles
from here; there is sufficient water there,
and forage, but as it would entail too great
a risk to leave his party on the other side
of Lawrell Hill, I shall give him instructions
to reconnoitre, &amp; to mark out the site
of the depot, &amp; then return to Edmund&rsquo;s
Swamp, where I will in the first place send
him a reinforcement with provisions, so
that he may make an entrenched camp
there, which will serve as flying base; and
if the report he makes of his route is
favourable, I shall send 600 men (in all) to
take a post at Loyal Hanny, which I conceive
to be the proper place for the chief
dep&ocirc;t; from there it will be more easy to
push his parties forward than from this
place. I hope you will be here before the
main detachment marches, and in that case
I shall go myself, if you approve. I wish
the new levies may be able to join before
that time, so as to be able to form the
three Pennsylvania battalions, and get
them into order. I shall have here the
two companies of workmen from Virginia,
to be employed in cutting the road as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as you shall have decided upon your route.
I shall await your arrival before beginning,
because the pack horses cross without difficulty,
and will suffice to carry their provisions.
As regards your route the Virginia
party continues in full force, and although
the secret motive of their policy seems to
me not above suspicion of partiality, it
nevertheless appears to me an additional
reason for acting with double caution in a
matter of this consequence, so as to have
ample answers for all their clamors, if any
accident happens, which they would not
fail to attribute to the choice of a fresh
route. Captain Patterson, who set out two
days after Captain Ward with a party of 13
men to reconnoitre the fort, has returned
with them without accomplishing anything.
He tried to cross the two mountains in a
direct line with the fort, but he found
Lawrell Hill impassible, and the different
reports agree in the fact that there is no
other pass to be found except the Indian
Path reconnoitred by Captain Ward. The
guide Dunning speaks of a gap he crossed
16 years ago, but no one knows this gap,
which he declares he found in &lsquo;Hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Horses.&rsquo; He is marching with the Major
and two or three other guides.... The
communication with Cumberland is cut,
and it is an excellent road.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>On July 20 Forbes wrote, by the hand of
St. Clair, to Bouquet asking that all the
guides then with him be sent to Carlisle
for a conference with the general. Three
days later Bouquet answered as follows:
&ldquo;Major Armstrong has three guides (and
three Indians) with him: McConnell, Brown
and Starrat. I am sending you all that are
left there,&mdash;Frazer, Walker, Garret, and
the two that are at Littleton,&mdash;Ohins and
Lowry. If those from Cumberland arrive
in time, I will send them on afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On July 25 Washington wrote Bouquet
from Fort Cumberland: &ldquo;I do not incline
to propose any thing that may seem officious,
but would it not facilitate the
operation of the campaign, if the Virginian
troops were ordered to proceed as far as
the Great Crossing, and construct forts at
the most advantageous situations as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
advance, opening the road at the same
time? In such a case, I should be glad to
be joined by that part of my regiment at
Raystown. Major Peachey, who commands
the working party on Braddock&rsquo;s road,
writes to me, that he finds few repairs
wanting. Tonight I shall order him to
proceed as far as Savage River, and then
return, as his party is too weak to adventure
further.... I shall most cheerfully
work on any road, pursue any route or enter
upon any service, that the General or yourself
may think me usefully imployed in, or
qualified for, and shall never have a will
of my own, when a duty is required of me.
But since you desire me to speak my sentiments
freely, permit me to observe, that
after having conversed with all the guides,
and having been informed by others, who
have a knowledge of the country, I am convinced
that a road, to be compared with
General Braddock&rsquo;s, or indeed, that will be
fit for transportation even by packhorses,
cannot be made. I have no predilection
for the route you have in mind, not because
difficulties appear therein, but because I
doubt whether satisfaction can be given in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the execution of the plan. I know not
what reports you may have received from
your reconnoitring parties; but I have been
uniformly told, that, if you expect a tolerable
road by Raystown, you will be disappointed,
for no movement can be made that
way without destroying our horses. I
should be extremely glad of one hour&rsquo;s
conference with you, when the General
arrives. I could then explain myself more
fully, and, I think, demonstrate the advantages
of pushing out a body of light troops
in this quarter. I would make a trip to
Raystown with great pleasure, if my presence
here could be dispensed with for a
day or two, of which you can best judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Washington&rsquo;s letter came also one
from General Forbes, written July 23.
From it these extracts are to the point:
&ldquo;As I disclaim all parties (factions) myself,
I should be sorry that they were to Creep
in amongst us. I therefore conceive what
the Virginia folks would be at, for to me
it appears to be them, and them only, that
want to drive us into the road by Fort
Cumberland, no doubt in opposition to the
Pennsylvanians who by Raes town would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
have a nigher Communication (than them)
to the Ohio. S<sup>ir</sup> John St. Clair was the
first person that proposed and enforced me
in to take the road by Raes town, I having
previous to this ordered our Army to
assemble at Conegochegue which I was
obliged afterwards to alter to Raestown at
his Instance, altho he then declared that he
nor nobody else knew any thing of the road
leading from the Laurell hill, but as he has
represented it of late impracticable to me,
I was therefore pressing to have the Communication
opened from Raes town to Fort
Cumberland. S<sup>ir</sup> John I am afraid had got
a new light at Winchester, and I believe
from thence proceeded to the opening the
road from Fort Frederick to Fort Cumberland.
I put the Question fairly to him
yesterday morning by asking him if he
knew of any Intention of making me change
measures and forcing me into the Fort
Cumberland road, when he knew that it
was at his Instance solely, that I had
changed it to Raes town; I showed him
Cap<sup>t</sup> Ward&rsquo;s Journal &amp; description of the
road from Raestown to the top of the Laurell
Hill, telling him at the same time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that if an easy road could be found there,
or made there, that I was amazed he should
know nothing off it, which was evident by
his telling me of late that the Laurel hill
was impracticable, he appeared nonplused,
but rather than appear ignorant, he said
that there were many Indian Traders that
knew those roads very well; I stopt him
short by saying if that was the case, that I
was very sorry he had never found them
out, or never thought it worth his while to
examine them. In short he knows nothing
of the matter. Col<sup>l</sup> Byrd in a paragraph
of his letter from Fort Cumberland,
amongst other things writes, that he has
upwards of sixty Indians waiting my
arrival, and ready to accompany me, but
they will not follow me unless I go by Fort
Cumberland. This is a new system of
military Discipline truly; and shows that
my Good friend Byrd is either made the
Cats Foot of himself, or he little knows me,
if he imagines that Sixty scoundrels are to
direct me in my measures. As we are now
so far advanced as Raestown I should look
fickle in my measures, in changing, to go
by Fort Cumberland, without being made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
thoroughly sensible of the impracticability
of passing by the shortest way over the
Laurell Hill to the Ohio. The difference
at present in the length of road the one
way and the other stands thus&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Raestown to Fort Cumberland,
34 miles or upwards</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Fort Cumberland to Fort Duquesne
by Ge<sup>nl</sup> Braddocks, 125 miles in all
160 to which add the passage of rivers &amp;c
and the last 8 miles not cut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other road&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Raestown to the top of the Laurell
Hill 46 miles</p>

<p>&ldquo;From then to Fort Duquesne suppose
40 or 50 miles in all 90 with no rivers to
obstruct you and nothing to stop you that
I can see, except the Bugbear, a tremendous
pass of the Laurel Hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If what I say is true and those two
roads are compared, I don&rsquo;t see that I am
to Hesitate one moment which to take
unless I take a party [join a faction] likewise,
which I hope never to do in Army
matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have now told you my Opinion, and
what I think of the affairs of the road, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to judge at such Distance, and of a Country
I never saw, nor heard spoke off but in
Cap<sup>t</sup> Ward&rsquo;s account, I therefore can say
nothing decisive, so have sent up S<sup>ir</sup> John
St Clair in order that he may explore that
new road and determine the most Ellegible
to be pursued, but this I think need not
hinder you from proceeding upon the new
road as soon as you can Conveniently....
I have spoke very roundly upon this subject
[roads and forage] to S<sup>ir</sup> John, who was
sent up the Country from Philadelphia for
no other purpose than to fix the roads and
provide forage, both of which I am sorry
to say it, are yet to begin&mdash;but all this
<i>entre nous</i> until I see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the same date (July 25) General
Forbes wrote as follows to Major-general
Abercrombie: &ldquo;Scouting Parties have been
sent out, with the best Guides we could
find, and according to the Reports which
some of them have made, the Road over
the Allegeny Mountain and the Lawrel
Ridge will be found practicable for Carriages,
which will be of infinate Consequence,
will facilitate Our Matters much
by shortening the March at least 70 miles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
besides the Advantage of having no Rivers
to pass, as We shall keep the Yeogheny
upon our Left.... The Troops are all
in Motion ... but I have Retarded the
March of some of them upon the Route
from this Place, as I am unwilling to bring
them together till the Route is finally
determined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth Bouquet wrote
Forbes as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sending you a letter I have
received from Major Armstrong. By the
report of the two guides he sent out it
seems the thing is very practicable; in an
affair of so much consequence as this I
thought I ought to act with greatest caution.
While the waggoner returned today
with an escort to reconnoitre how the road
could be laid so as to avoid all the detours
and windings of the path; and I have asked
Colonel Burd to go with Rhor tomorrow to
the top of the mountain (Allegheny) to
determine the straightest line from here to
the foot of the ascent, and to mark the
turnings of the road to reach the top. I
hope you will be here on their return, and
could then judge if it would be well to risk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
this route. In 3 days the Major will return
to Edmund&rsquo;s Swamp, where there is abundant
forage, and he will let me know what
we must expect from Lawrell Hill. A man
who has been 50 times by this path to the
Ohio says that the remainder of the route
after Loyal Hanny is a long series of hills,
with swamps and bogs, but not of great
ascent. He is a man named Fergusson,
very limited, from whom one can elicit
nothing precise; I have sent him with the
Major and Dunnings. Upon the Major&rsquo;s
report, we shall be sure of the route as far
as Loyal Hanny; and, as regards the
remainder, I am sending out Captain Patterson
tomorrow with 4 men, to follow this
same path to the end, and return forthwith
to report, observing the bad places, and the
facilities afforded by the country for obviating
them, such as trees, stones, &amp;c., the
quantity of grass and water, the defiles,
distances, &amp;c. He ought to be back in 12
days at latest. Colonel Washington has
had the beginning of the road cut from
Braddock, [along Braddock&rsquo;s Road?] which
I have fixed at 10 miles from Fort Cumberland.
You will have been informed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
guides I sent you of the advantages of this
route which is open, and needs very little
in the way of repair; its drawbacks consist
in the want of forage, its length, its defiles,
and the crossing of rivers. Colonel Washington,
who is animated with sincere zeal
to contribute to the success of this expedition,
and is ready to march wheresoever
you may decide, writes me that, from all
he has heard and from all the information
he has been able to collect, our route is
impracticable even for packhorses, so bad
are the mountains, and that the Braddock
road is the only one to take &amp;c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, my dear General, you have in
brief the reports and opinions which have
reached me; I will add no reflection of my
own, hoping to see you every day. Do
you not think it would be well to see Colonel
Washington here, before making your
decision? and if our parties continue to
send favourable news, to convert him to
give way to the evidence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In reply to Washington&rsquo;s letter of the
twenty-fifth Bouquet wrote: &ldquo;Nothing can
exceed your generous dispositions for the
service. I see with the utmost satisfac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>tion,
that you are above the influences of
prejudice, and ready to go heartily where
reason and judgement shall direct. I wish,
sincerely, that we may all entertain one
and the same opinion; therefore I desire
to have an interview with you at the houses
built half way between our camps. I will
communicate all the intelligence, which it
has been in my power to collect; and, by
weighing impartially the advantages and
disadvantages of each route, I hope we
shall be able to determine what is most
eligible, and save the General trouble and
loss of time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Concerning this meeting Washington
wrote as follows to his friend Major Francis
Halket, then in Forbes&rsquo;s camp at Carlisle:
&ldquo;I am just returned (August 2<sup>nd</sup>)<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> from
a conference with Colonel Bouquet. I find
him fixed, I think I may say unalterably
fixed, to lead you a new way to the Ohio,
through a road, every inch of which is to
be cut at this advanced season, when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
have scarce time left to tread the beaten
track, universally confessed to be the best
passage through the mountains. If Colonel
Bouquet succeeds in this point with the
General, all is lost,&mdash;all is lost indeed,&mdash;our
enterprise will be ruined, and we shall
be stopped at the Laurel Hill this winter;
but not to gather <i>laurels</i>, except of the kind
that covers the mountains. The Southern
Indians will turn against us, and these
colonies will be desolated by such an accession
to the enemy&rsquo;s strength. These must
be the consequences of a miscarriage; and a
miscarriage is the almost necessary consequence
of our attempt to march the army by
this new route. I have given my reasons at
large to Colonel Bouquet. He desired that
I would do so, that he might forward them
to the General. Should this happen, you
will be able to judge of their weight. I
am uninfluenced by prejudice, having no
hopes or fears but for the general good.
Of this you may be assured, and that my
sincere sentiments are spoken on this
occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concerning the same interview Bouquet
wrote Forbes (July 31): &ldquo;I have had an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
interview with Colonel Washington, to
ascertain how he conceives the difficulties
could be overcome; I got no satisfaction
from it; <i>the majority of these gentlemen do
not know the difference between a party and an
army</i>, and, overlooking all difficulties, they
believe everything to be easy which flatters
their ideas. What I shall have to tell you
on this point cannot be discussed in a
letter....&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this same letter Bouquet wrote, concerning
the general situation: &ldquo;You will
see from the extract appended from Major
Armstrong&rsquo;s letters the report he makes
thereupon. All seems practicable and even
easy, but I put too little confidence in the
observations of a young man without
experience to act upon his judgement. I
have therefore sent Colonel Burd, Rhor
and Captain Ward to reconnoitre the Allegheny,
to make an examination of all the
difficulties, and thus put me into a position
to decide what reliance is to be placed on
the rest of the discoveries. Unfortunately
they have found things very different,
and this mountain which these gentlemen
crossed so easily is worse than Seydeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Hill, and the ascent much longer. Considering
that it was impossible to cut a
waggon road on this slope without immense
labour, they searched along the mountain
for another pass, and found about two miles
to the North a gap of which no one was
aware.... It seems that, with much
labour, one might make a much easier road
there than the other; it remains to be seen
what obstacles are still to be encountered
before Loyal Hanning. Sir John has
arrived, and I have communicated to him
all I know on the subject; and he starts
today or tomorrow morning with Colonel
Burd, Rhor and 200 men to reconnoitre
this gap, and the whole route as far as
Loyal Hanning. He will spend 6 or 7 days
on this survey, and I hope on his return
you will be able to form a decision. And,
in order that no time may be lost, I will
make a commencement of the work if the
thing is practicable without awaiting your
orders. I have thought it best not to do
so up to the present, in order not to lay
ourselves open to public reflections if we
commenced and abandoned different routes.
I agree with you that you cannot take the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Cumberland route untill you are in a position
to demonstrate the impossibility of
finding another road, or at any rate the
impossibility of opening one without risking
the expedition by too great an expenditure
of time. We are in a cruel position,
if you are reduced to a single line of
communication. It is 64 miles from Cumberland
to Gist, and there are only three
places capable of furnishing forage sufficient
for the army; the rest would not
suffice for a single night. The frost, which
commences at the end of October, destroys
all the grass, and the rivers overflowing in
the spring cut off all communication....
If we open a new route, we have not enough
axes.&rdquo; On the same day Forbes wrote
Bouquet by the hand of Halket a decisive
letter in which he said: &ldquo;he [Forbes]
thinks that no time should be lost in making
the new Road, he has directed me to
inform you that you are immediately to
begin the opening of it agreeable to the
manner he wrote to you in his last letter,
as he sees all the advantages he can propose
by going that Route, and will avoid
innumerable Inconveniencys he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
encounter was he to go the other, he is at
the same time extremely surprised at the
partial disposition that appears in those
Virginia Gentlemans sentiments, as there
can be no sort of comparison between the
two Routes when you consider the situation
of the Troops now at Reastown, &amp; that
their is not the least reason to expect that
we shall meet with any difficulties but
what may be easily surmounted.&rdquo; On the
next day but one Forbes wrote: &ldquo;he [Halket]
told you my opinion of the Laurell
Hill road, and that I thought it ought to be
sett about directly, as it is good to have two
Strings to one Bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this day Washington wrote a last
letter to Bouquet in behalf of the Braddock
route:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matters, of which we spoke relative
to the roads, have since our parting,
been the subject of my closest reflection;
and, so far am I from altering my opinion,
that, the more time and attention I bestow,
the more I am confirmed in it; and the
reasons for taking Braddock&rsquo;s road appear
in a stronger point of view. To enumerate
the whole of these reasons would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
tedious, and to you, who are become so
much master of the subject, unnecessary. I
shall therefore, briefly mention a few only,
which I think so obvious in themselves,
that they must effectually remove objections.
Several years ago the Virginians
and Pennsylvanians commenced a trade
with the Indians settled on the Ohio, and,
to obviate the many inconveniencies of a
bad road, they, after reiterated and ineffectual
efforts to discover where a good one
might be made, employed for the purpose
several of the most intelligent Indians,
who, in the course of many years&rsquo; hunting,
had acquired a perfect knowledge of these
mountains. The Indians, having taken the
greatest pains to gain the rewards offered
for this discovery, declared, that the path
leading from Will&rsquo;s Creek was infinitely
preferable to any, that could be made at any
other place. Time and experience so clearly
demonstrated this truth, that the Pennsylvania
traders commonly carried out their
goods by Will&rsquo;s Creek. Therefore, the
Ohio Company, in 1753, at a considerable
expense, opened the road. In 1754 the
troops, whom I had the honor to command,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
greatly repaired it, as far as Gist&rsquo;s plantation;
and, in 1755, it was widened and
completed by General Braddock to within
six miles of Fort Duquesne. A road, that
has so long been opened, and so well and
so often repaired, must be much firmer and
better than a new one, allowing the ground
to be equally good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, supposing it were practicable to
make a road from Raystown quite as good
as General Braddock&rsquo;s,&mdash;I ask, have we
time to do it? Certainly not. To surmount
the difficulties to be encountered in
making it over such mountains, covered
with woods and rocks, would require so
much time, as to blast our otherwise well-grounded
hopes of striking the important
stroke this season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The favorable accounts, that some give
of the forage on the Raystown road, as
being so much better than that on the
other, are certainly exaggerated. It is
well known, that, on both routes, the rich
valleys between the mountains abound with
good forage, and that those, which are
stony and bushy, are destitute of it.
Colonel Byrd and the engineer, who accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>panied
him, confirm this fact. Surely the
meadows on Braddock&rsquo;s road would greatly
overbalance the advantage of having grass
to the foot of the ridge, on the Raystown
road; and all agree, that a more barren
road is nowhere to be found, than that from
Raystown to the inhabitants, which is likewise
to be considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another principal objection made to
General Braddock&rsquo;s road is in regard to the
waters. But these seldom swell so much,
as to obstruct the passage. The Youghiogany
River, which is the most rapid and
soonest filled, I have crossed with a body
of troops, after more than thirty days&rsquo;
almost continued rain. In fine, any difficulties
on this score are so trivial, that they
really are not worth mentioning. The
Monongahela, the largest of all these rivers,
may, if necessary, easily be avoided, as Mr.
Frazer the principal guide informs me, by
passing a defile, and even that, he says,
may be shunned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, it is said, there are many defiles
on this road. I grant that there are some,
but I know of none that may not be traversed;
and I should be glad to be informed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
where a road can be had, over these mountains,
not subject to the same inconvenience.
The shortness of the distance between
Raystown and Loyal Hanna is used as an
argument against this road, which bears in
it something unaccountable to me; for I
must beg leave to ask, whether it requires
more time, or is more difficult and expensive,
to go one hundred and forty-five miles
in a good road already made to our hands,
than to cut one hundred miles anew, and a
great part of the way over impassable
mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the old road is many miles nearer
Winchester in Virginia, and Fort Frederic
in Maryland, than the contemplated one, is
incontestable; and I will here show the
distances from Carlisle by the two routes,
fixing the different stages, some of which
I have from information only, but others I
believe to be exact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this computation there appears to
be a difference of nineteen miles only.
Were all the supplies necessarily to come
from Carlisle, it is well known, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>goodness of the old road is a sufficient compensation
for the shortness of the other, as
the wrecked and broken wagons there
clearly demonstrate....</p>

<p>&ldquo;... From what has been said relative

clear, that the old one is infinitely better,
than the other can be made, and that there
is no room to hesitate in deciding which
to take, when we consider the advanced
season, and the little time left to execute
our plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Forbes&rsquo;s letter of the thirty-first was
decisive, and, following his orders, Colonel
Bouquet began cutting a new road westward
from Raystown August 1.</p>

<h3>THE NEW ROAD</h3>


<p>The correspondence included in the
chapter preceding affords probably
the utmost light that can be thrown
today upon the reason of the making of the
great Pennsylvanian thoroughfare to the
Ohio. It cannot be affirmed, as has often
been said, that Forbes was early prejudiced
in favor of a Pennsylvania route; he never
could have been such a hypocrite as to pen
the words to be found on page 94. That
his first plans were completely altered at
the advice of Sir John St. Clair is very
plain from his letters to Governor Denny
(March 20) and to Colonel Bouquet (July
6); but up to the very last he leaves the
question open, to be decided wholly according
to the reports of the guides and
explorers. It is difficult, however, to
reconcile the words in Forbes&rsquo;s letter to
Bouquet of July 23, in which he states<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
that St. Clair, when advising the Raystown
route, affirmed &ldquo;that he nor nobody else
knew anything of the road leading from
Laurell hill.&rdquo; It is evident from this that
Forbes originally expected to fall down to
the Braddock road from Raystown, but that
when once on the ground, with the distances
clear in his mind, he was compelled to find
a shorter road westward if there was one
to be found. This is the only explanation
of his immediate change of plan at St.
Clair&rsquo;s advice, knowing that St. Clair had
found no route westward by Laurel Hill;
it seems that St. Clair thought only of proceeding
via Raystown to Fort Cumberland,
as he affirmed in his letter of June 9 to
Bouquet. St. Clair was undoubtedly right
in deciding that the best course to Fort
Cumberland from Philadelphia for the
army was through populous Pennsylvania,
and his understanding that the Braddock
Road would be followed from that point
would easily explain why he had provided
forage at Fort Cumberland, which occasioned
Forbes&rsquo;s criticism in his letter of
July 14. Indeed from Forbes&rsquo;s letters of
June 16, 19, and 27, it does not seem that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
had any definite plan for the construction
of a new road.</p>

<p>On the other hand Forbes very correctly
doubted the advisability of using Braddock&rsquo;s
long route when his army was once gathered
together along the road from Carlisle
to Raystown. Bouquet stated his (Forbes&rsquo;s)
position very soundly when he said: &ldquo;You
cannot take the Cumberland until you are
in a position to demonstrate the impossibility
of finding another road, or at any rate
the impossibility of opening one without
risking the expedition by too great an
expenditure of time.&rdquo; Moreover, Forbes
had a comprehensive view of the situation
such as probably no one else had.</p>

<p>So far as Bouquet&rsquo;s position was concerned,
his correspondence shows that he
was assiduous in carrying out Forbes&rsquo;s
directions; as to any conspiracy on his part
to win Forbes over to the Pennsylvania
route, as Washington insinuated, who can
believe one existed after reading his letters?
Bouquet very properly threw the burden
of ultimate decision upon Forbes, as it was
his duty to do; he sent him all the information
which he could obtain, pro and con,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
concerning all routes; he sent Colonel Burd
out, with his guides, in order to have testimony
upon which he was sure he could
rely; he urged Forbes to defer his decision
of route until he (Forbes) could have a
personal interview with Washington; he
had Braddock&rsquo;s Road partly cleared and
plainly described it as needing &ldquo;very little
in the way of repair;&rdquo; he never seems to
have attempted to minimize the difficulties
of making a new route or maximize those
of the old; he continually urges the necessity
of great caution in the selection of a
route.</p>

<p>The motives which directed the movements
of Sir John St. Clair during these
months of controversy are quite beyond
fathoming. It is easy to believe that the
&ldquo;new light,&rdquo; which Forbes said Sir John
had received &ldquo;at Winchester,&rdquo; made it
clear that if he did not send the army over
the southern route (Fort Frederick-Fort
Cumberland) to Cumberland, it was possible
that Forbes would never traverse Braddock&rsquo;s
Road at all. It is certain that upon
Governor Sharpe&rsquo;s and Washington&rsquo;s
arrival upon the scene, Sir John began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
shower upon Bouquet letters advising the
opening of the Fort Frederick-Fort Cumberland
road; &ldquo;and I believe from thence,&rdquo;
Forbes wrote of St. Clair&rsquo;s meeting with
Governor Sharpe, &ldquo;proceeded to the opening
the road from Fort Frederick to Fort
Cumberland.&rdquo; Indeed, it would be interesting
to know whether it was not St.
Clair&rsquo;s suddenly raised clamor over the
length of the Raystown route to Fort Cumberland
(hoping to &ldquo;drive&rdquo; Forbes over
the Fort Frederick route) that determined
Forbes to ignore Fort Cumberland and push
out on a new, shorter route to the Ohio.</p>

<p>Whatever were St. Clair&rsquo;s reasons for
such vacillating plans, it is sure he fell
into disgrace in Forbes&rsquo;s eyes. In addition
to the upbraiding he received from the
general&rsquo;s own lips, Forbes wrote in his
letter of July 14 that the wagons were the
plague of his life and denied that St. Clair
had taken &ldquo;the smallest pains&rdquo; or made
the &ldquo;least inquiry&rdquo; concerning the matters
he had been detailed to care for. Again,
in Forbes&rsquo;s letter to Bouquet of July 17
he says: &ldquo;Sir John acknowledges taking
some (kettles &amp;c. from Pennsylvania troops)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and applying them to the use of the
Virginians &amp;c. which is terrible.&rdquo; In a
letter previously quoted Forbes affirms that
St. Clair&mdash;who was sent in advance of the
army to settle the matter of route&mdash;&ldquo;knows
nothing of the matter.&rdquo; Forbes&rsquo;s wrath at
St. Clair reached a climax before the end of
August when he savagely declared that he
suspected his &ldquo;heart as well as the head.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>And now as to Washington. His letters
are typical of the young man to whom these
western forests were not unfamiliar; they
are patriotic and loyal. Though he was
standing for election to the House of Burgesses
in his home county, he had refused
to accept a leave of absence to do his electioneering&mdash;which
in no wise prevented
his election. I cannot find any ill-boding
prophecy in his letters, concerning the
making of a new road westward from Raystown,
which after events did not justify.
He affirmed that Forbes could not reach
Fort Duquesne by a new road before the
winter set in; and no prophecy ever seemed
more accurately fulfilled. For before Fort
Duquesne was reached it was decided not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to attempt to continue the campaign
further. An unexpected occurrence suddenly
turned the tide and Forbes went
on&mdash;to a splendid conquest. But, nevertheless,
Washington&rsquo;s prophecy was, not
long after it was made, found to have been
that of a wise man. Had Forbes been one
iota less fortunate than Braddock was unfortunate,
Washington&rsquo;s words would have
come true to the letter. So much for his
judgment, which Forbes ignored.</p>

<p>But Washington&rsquo;s knowledge was limited,
so far as the general situation of the
army was concerned. Forbes&rsquo;s expedition
was one of three simultaneous campaigns;
and the three commanders were somewhat
dependent upon each other. At any time
Forbes might be called upon to give assistance
to Abercrombie or Johnson. Forbes
was in constant correspondence with both
of his colleagues; after Abercrombie&rsquo;s
repulse the prosecution of the Fort Duquesne
campaign, it may almost be said,
was in question. At any rate it was important
to have open the shortest possible
route of communication to the northern
colonies where the other campaigns were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
being pushed; in case Fort Duquesne was
captured a straight road through populous,
grain-growing Pennsylvania would be of
utmost importance; especially as Pennsylvania
abounded in vehicles, while in
Virginia they were scarce.</p>

<p>Washington thought only of a quick
campaign completed in the same season as
begun. Forbes, however, was not in eager
haste and had good reason for moving
slowly. As early as August 9 he wrote
Bouquet: &ldquo;Between you and I be it said,
as we are now so late, we are yet too soon.
This is a parable that I shall soon explain.&rdquo;
Three reasons appealed to Forbes for moving
slowly, though it is doubtful if he
intended moving as slowly as he actually
did move: Frederick Post, the missionary,
had been sent to the Indians on the Beaver
asking them to withdraw from the French;
the Indian chiefs were invited to the treaty
at Easton, where their alliance with the
French would, it was hoped, be undermined;
winter was drawing on apace, when
the Indians who were with the French
would withdraw to their villages and begin
to prepare for the inclement season.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the direct serious charges brought
against Washington was that he did &ldquo;not
know the difference between a party and an
army.&rdquo; This is brought by Colonel Bouquet
and I do not believe that he was in
error or that the accusation can be proved
unjust. Washington had had much experience,
such as it was, in the Fort Necessity
campaign, with Braddock, and on the Virginia
frontier. But the Fort Necessity
campaign was conspicuous as a political,
not a military event. The force he led
west did not number two hundred men.
This was, surely, a party, not an army.
Now, be it remembered, the great difficulty
of leading any body of men, small or great,
lay in provisioning them and feeding the
horses. The larger the army the greater
the difficulty&mdash;indeed the difficulty trebled
as the number of men and horses was
doubled. On those mountain roads the
second wagon was drawn with much greater
difficulty than the first. Again, a small
body of men could, in part, be supplied
with food from the forests; in the case of an
army this source of supply must be ignored.
In the case of Washington&rsquo;s Fort Necessity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
campaign, how did his handful of men fare?
They nearly starved&mdash;and capitulated
because they did not have the food to give
them the necessary strength to retreat.
This was not Washington&rsquo;s fault, for he,
properly, left this matter with those whose
business it was; but the experience certainly
did not teach him how to handle an army.</p>

<p>I cannot see that he had the opportunity
to learn much more in Braddock&rsquo;s campaign
in 1755. He was that general&rsquo;s aide, a carrier
of messages and orders, and a member
of the military family. He had ever before
his eyes a thousand examples of carelessness,
chicanery, and mismanagement, but
those could not teach him how an army was
to be cared for properly. His advice was
often asked and minded, but he gave it in
the capacity of a frontiersman, not as a
tactician or officer. The one exception was
when he urged that Braddock divide the
<i>army</i> into two <i>parties</i> by sending a small
flying column rapidly against Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>It is clear from preceding pages that, on
the Virginia frontier, he learned no lessons
on the control of large bodies of men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>But now, in 1758, as colonel of an important
branch of the army General Forbes was
throwing across the Alleghenies, Washington
came forward conspicuously as a champion
of a certain route to be pursued by an
army of five thousand men. Frankly, what
did he know of the needs of five thousand
men on a march of two hundred miles from
their base of supplies? His correspondence
on this point is not satisfactory. He had
never passed over the Pennsylvania Road,
and, though he understood better than anyone
what it meant to cut a new road, he
does not answer the argument that the
Braddock Road failed to offer as much
pasturage for horses and cattle as the Pennsylvania
route. He confines himself largely
to the matter of celerity: and the situation,
as we have explained, did not demand
haste. Forbes had the best of reasons for
moving slowly. From a commissary&rsquo;s
standpoint Washington&rsquo;s argument could
have had no weight whatever.</p>

<p>Washington was strongly prejudiced in
favor of the Virginia route; and no man
could have had better reasons for prejudice,
as will be shown. He argued conspicuously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and vehemently on a subject with which
he had no experience. Great and good as
he became, and brave and faithful as he
was, it is all the easier to confess to a weakness
which was due to a lack of experience
and to loyal, old-time Virginia pride. It
is an exceedingly pleasant duty to emphasize
the fact that, after his repeated arguments
were cast aside by his superiors and a
route was chosen in the face of the strongest
opposition he could bring to bear on the
subject, the young man swallowed his
chagrin and the slights under which his
fine spirit must have writhed, and worked
manfully and heroically for measures which
he had heartily opposed. In all that he had
done in the past five years he never played
the man better than here and now.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to unravel what General
Forbes continually calls the plot of
certain Virginians to force him into Braddock&rsquo;s
Road. The matter is of additional
interest because, in his letter to Bouquet
of August 9, Forbes utters a very sharp
criticism of Washington: &ldquo;By a very
unguarded letter of Col. Washington&rsquo;s that
accidentally fell into my hands, I am now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
at the bottom of their scheme against this
new road, a scheme that I think was a
shame for any officer to be concerned in,
but more of this at [our] meeting.&rdquo; Again
on September 4 he wrote: &ldquo;Therefore [I]
would consult C. Washington, altho perhaps
not follow his advice, as his Behaviour
about the roads, was in no ways like a
soldier.&rdquo; What letter this was of Washington&rsquo;s
I do not know. It could not have
been the letter written to Halket (page 113);
it hardly seems possible that it could have
been the following letter which Washington
wrote to Governor Fouquier: &ldquo;The Pennsylvanians,
whose present as well as future
interest it was to have the expedition conducted
through their government, and
along that way, because it secures their
frontiers at present, and their trade hereafter,
a chain of forts being erected, had
prejudiced the General absolutely against
the old road, and made him believe that we
were the partial people, and determined
him at all events to pursue that route.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The doubt is not whether Forbes would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
have spoken sharply if he had seen this
letter, but whether it could have fallen into
his hands. It was undoubtedly sent from
Fort Cumberland straight to Winchester
and Williamsburg. From one point the
letter does Washington no credit, though
it shows plainly that there was a bitter
factional fight and that he felt strongly the
righteousness of the Virginian side of the
question, for which he is not to be blamed.
As to his accusation against his general, it
seems to me unreasonably bitter. Forbes&rsquo;s
correspondence with Bouquet is convincing
proof of the falseness of Washington&rsquo;s
theory that the Pennsylvanians &ldquo;had prejudiced
the General absolutely against the
old road ... and determined him at all
events to pursue that (new) route.&rdquo; After
wrestling with the route question two
months Forbes wrote General Abercrombie
as late as July 25 that he was unwilling to
bring the divisions of his army together
&ldquo;till the Route is finally determined.&rdquo;
Forbes had no predilection for Pennsylvanians;
when, in September, a spirit of
jealousy appeared concerning the province
from which the army provisions should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
obtained, Forbes wrote Bouquet (September
17): &ldquo;I believe neither you nor I values
one farthing where we get provisions from,
provided we are supplyed, or Interest ourselves
either with Virginia or Pennsylvania,
which last I hope will be damn&rsquo;d for their
treatment of us with the Waggons, and
every other thing where they could profit
by us from their impositions, altho at the
risque of our perdition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The controversy as to whether Forbes&rsquo;s
route should be through Pennsylvania or
Virginia serves to bring into clear perspective
one of the most interesting and one of
the most important phases of our study&mdash;the
meaning of the building of a road at
that time to either one of those colonies.
Nothing could emphasize this more than
the sharpness of the quarrel and the position
of those concerned in it. It meant very
much to Pennsylvania to have Forbes cut a
road to the Ohio in both of the two ways
suggested by Washington to Governor
Fouquier&mdash;it fortified her frontier and
opened a future avenue of trade. The Old
Trading Path had been her best course
westward and her trade with the Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
had been nothing to what it would now
become. But such as it had been, it was
most distasteful to the Virginians to the
south who called the West their own.
This rivalry was intense for more than a
quarter of a century and came near ending
in bloodshed; the quarrel was only forgotten
in the tumultuous days of 1775. General
Forbes seems to have understood very
well that his new road would be of utmost
importance to Pennsylvania as that province
would then have a &ldquo;nigher Communication
[than Virginia] to the Ohio;&rdquo; and that was
the very reason he cut it: because it was
shorter&mdash;not to please Pennsylvania. If
Fort Duquesne was to be captured and fortified
and manned and supplied, the shortest
route thither would be, as the dark days of
1764 and 1775 and 1791 proved, a desperately
long road to travel.</p>

<p>On the other hand the building of
Forbes&rsquo;s road in Pennsylvania was a boon
which that province far less deserved than
Virginia. Virginia men and capital were
foremost in the field for securing the Indian
trade of the Ohio; they had, nearly ten
years before, secured a grant of land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
between the Monongahela and Kanawha,
and sent explorers and a number of pioneers
to occupy the land; their private means
had been given to clear the first white
man&rsquo;s road thither and erect storehouses at
Wills Creek and Redstone; the activity of
these ambitious, worthy men had brought
on the war now existing. When open strife
became the colonies&rsquo; only hope of holding
the West, Virginia was first and foremost
in the field; the same spirit that showed
itself in commercial energy was very
evident when war broke out, and for four
years Virginia had given of her treasure
and of her citizens for the cause. During
this time Pennsylvania had hardly lifted a
finger, steadily pursuing a course which
brought down upon her legislators most
bitter invectives from every portion of the
colonies. And now, in the last year of the
war, the conquering army was to pass
through Pennsylvania to the Ohio, building
a road thither which should for all time
give this province an advantage very much
greater than that ever enjoyed by any of
the others. True, Braddock&rsquo;s Road curled
along over the mountains, but after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
defeat by the Monongahela it had never
been used except by small parties on foot
and had become well-nigh impassable otherwise.
We do not know what Washington
wrote in the letter which Forbes so roundly
criticised, but it can easily be conceived,
without detriment to his character, that he
might have spoken in a way Forbes could
not understand concerning lethargic Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
undeserved good fortune.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But
Forbes had the present to deal with, not
the past, and the shortest route to the Ohio
was all too long.</p>

<p>This became alarmingly plain in a very
short time after the day, August 1, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
which Bouquet began to cut it. The story
of the hewing of this road cannot be told
better than by quoting the fragments appertaining
to it contained in the letters of those
closely concerned in its building. Old
St. Clair, who, as we have seen, was sent
on by Forbes to Bouquet, was the advance
supervisor. As early as August 12 he was
writing Bouquet from &ldquo;Camp on y<sup>e</sup> Side
of Alleganys&rdquo; that not as much progress
had been made as he had hoped, and that
the &ldquo;Work to be done on this Road is immense.
Send as many men as you can with
digging tools, this is a most diabolical
work, and whiskey must be had. I told
you that the road wou&rsquo;d take 500 Men 5
Days in cutting to the Top of the Mountain.&rdquo;
On the sixteenth he wrote: &ldquo;A
small retrench<sup>t</sup> is picked out at Kikeny
Pawlings.&rdquo;</p>

Road, so you may send them back loaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forbes, writing to Bouquet, refers as
follows to the new road August 7: &ldquo;Extremely
well satisfied with your accounts
of the Road, and very glad to find that you
have, entered upon the making of it;&rdquo;
(August 9): &ldquo;I hope your new road advances
briskly, and that from the Alleghany Hill
to Laurell Hill may be carrying forward by
different partys, at the same time, that you
are making the pass of the Allegany practicable;&rdquo;
(August 15): &ldquo;I hope the new
road goes on fast and that soon we shall be
able to take post at Loyal Haning. I see
nothing that can facilitate this more than
by still amusing the Enemy by pushing
Considerable parties along M<sup>r</sup> Braddock&rsquo;s
route, which parties might endeavour to
try to find communications betwixt the two
roads where they approach the nearest, or
where most likely such passages can be
found. As it will be necessary very soon
to make a disposition of our small Army I
beg you will give your thoughts a little
that way. At present I think the greatest
part ought to be assembled at Raestown to
make our main push by that road, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Col<sup>l</sup> Washington, or some other officer
might push along the other road and might
join us if a Communication can be found
when called upon. But this is only an Idea
in Embryo....&rdquo; (August 18): &ldquo;In carrying
forward the new road I think there
might easily be a small road carried on at
the same time, at about 100 yards to the
right and left of it, and parallel with it, by
which our flanking partys might advance
easier along with the line. I dont mean
here to cut down any large trees, only to
clear away the Brushwood and saplins, so
as the men either on foot or on horseback
may pass the easier along....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bouquet forwarded this order to St. Clair
on August 23, also writing: &ldquo;Colonel Burd
is to command on the West of Lawrell Hill,
and to march without delay and before the
Road is cut to Loyal H&mdash; [Hannan].&rdquo; On
the same date St. Clair wrote Bouquet
from Stoney Creek as follows: &ldquo;I wrote
you yesterday ... that three waggons
have got to this place, the Road not so
good as I shall make it.... I hope to get
to Kikoney Pawlins to morrow night, if
not shall do it next day. Tell Mr Sinclair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to send me my Down Quilt the weather is
cold.&rdquo; That evening he wrote again, in
reply to Bouquet&rsquo;s letter, from &ldquo;Kikoney
Paulins:&rdquo; &ldquo;It is impossible for me to tell
you any more than I have done about
the Road to L&mdash; H&mdash; [Loyal Hannan]. I
required 600 Men to make the Road over
the Lai Ri&mdash;ge in three days on condition
I was to see it done my Self, and perhaps
I might reach L&mdash; H the 3<sup>d</sup> Day. I expect
to get the Road cleared as far as the
clear fields a Mile from the foot of L&mdash;R
on this Side, by the time the A&mdash;y [army]
comes up, and work afterwards with as
many men as the Other Corps will give
me.&rdquo; From Edmonds Swamp St. Clair
wrote next (no date): &ldquo;I got the Waggons
safe as far as this post yesterday the road
is so far good, and if it had not rain&rsquo;d so
hard I was in hopes to report the Road
good this Night to Kikoney Pawlings....
If you think the Road from Rays town to
the Shanoe Cabins will be wet in the autumn,
it wou&rsquo;d be well to open the Road
over the two Risings, and it wou&rsquo;d be
shorter for our Returned Waggons. I shall
send out a Reconoitering party 25 Miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
northward that we may know the Paths
that lead to sidling Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the last of August all parties concerned
were beginning to realize that the
young Washington had been telling some
plain truth when he urged Forbes not to
try this new route. On the twenty-seventh
Bouquet wrote St. Clair: &ldquo;I am extremely
disappointed in my Expectation of the
Road being open before this time to the
foot of Lawrell Hill ... push that Road
with all possible dispatch ... the Chief
thing we want is the Communication open
for Waggons to Loyal Hannon. Employ
all your Strength there, and Colonel Burd
has order to cut backwards to you from L.
Han.... Capt Dudgeon and M<sup>r</sup> Dapt
will oversee some Part of the Road, and
every body is to stir and make amend for
their unaccountable slowness.&rdquo; Bouquet
blamed St. Clair for the delay and Forbes
wrote him from Shippensburg August 28:
&ldquo;The slow advance of the new road and
the cause of it touch me to the quick, it
was a thing I early foresaw and guarded
again[st] such an assistant with all the force
and Energy of words that I was master of,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
but being over ruled was resolved to make
the most I could of a wrong head ... the
Virginians who are able to march ...
might advance as far forward upon Braddock&rsquo;s
road as to that part of it which is
most contiguous to our second deposite,
which I think might be about Saltlick
Creek.... The using of Braddock&rsquo;s road
I have always had in mind was it only a
blind&mdash;pray lose no time as that does not
oblidge us to march, before we see proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forbes alone realized that despatch was
not to be, necessarily, the secret of the success
of his campaign, though he had urged
Bouquet to hasten the roadmaking as fast
as possible. He had his eyes fixed elsewhere
than on the Allegheny ranges; he
knew the Indians at Fort Duquesne were
weary of the listless campaign; that Bradstreet
had been sent against Fort Frontenac
(which, if captured, would shut Fort Duquesne
completely off from Quebec); that
by the first of September a hundred Indians
were already gathered at Easton ready for
a treaty; that the brave Post was now
among the Delawares bringing the final
opportunity for them to abandon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
French cause. On September 2 he wrote
Bouquet hinting of all these circumstances
and urging delay in everything but mere
road-building. On the sixth of September
Forbes wrote Pitt:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my last I had the honour to acquaint
you, of my proceedings in the new road
across the Alleganey mountains, and over
Laurell Hill, (leaving the Rivers Yohieganey
and Monongahela to my left hand)
strait to the Ohio, by which I have saved a
great deal of way, and prevented the misfortunes
that the overflowing of those rivers
might occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I acquainted you likewise of the suspicions
I had, of the small trust I could
repose in the Pennsylvanians in assisting
of me with anyone necessary, or any help
in furthering the service that they did not
think themselves compelled to do by the
words of your letter to them.... My
advanced post consisting of 1500 men, are
now in possession of a strong post 9 miles
on the other side of Laurell Hill, and about
40 from Fort Du Quesne, nor had the
Enemy even suspected my attempting such
a road till very lately, they having been all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
along securing the strong passes, and fords
of the rivers upon Gen<sup>l</sup> Braddock&rsquo;s route.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forbes had been in Philadelphia while
Bouquet was struggling away at Raystown
with his thousand perplexities. Early in
July he had proceeded to Carlisle where he
remained stricken down &ldquo;with a cursed
flux&rdquo; until the eleventh of August. Two
days later he reached Shippensburg, where
he was again prostrated and unable to
advance until the middle of September.
It is difficult to realize that the campaign
had been directed so largely by this prostrate
man whose &ldquo;excruciating pains&rdquo;
often left him &ldquo;as weak as a new-born
infant&rdquo; and who, when able to be about
camp, retired &ldquo;at eight at night, if able to
sit up so late.&rdquo; All of this might well have
been stated long ago but it is of particular
significance now that Forbes&rsquo;s correspondence
of the whole summer has been
systematically reviewed. The very trials<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and perplexities, the crying need for his
bravery and resolution, seemed in a measure
to keep him alive.</p>

<p>No one can study this campaign without
yearning to know more of the impetuous
soul which threw its last grain of strength
into making it a triumphant success. The
Indians called Forbes &ldquo;The Head of Iron&rdquo;&mdash;and
no words can better describe the
man. Giving all praise possible to Bouquet
for his sturdy and active service throughout
the summer, it is still plain that the
dying Forbes was the magnetic influence
that made others strong. Those were dark
days at Raystown when at last the pale
general arrived upon the ground; &ldquo;had
not the General come up,&rdquo; wrote an officer
on the spot, &ldquo;the Consequence wou&rsquo;d have
been dangerous.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Bouquet was an invaluable
man but the &ldquo;Head of Iron&rdquo; in
command was needed.</p>

<p>The remainder of the campaign has been
often told and in detail. Washington and
his Virginians came northward over the
newly-cut road to Fort Bedford at Rays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>town
and plunged westward to the Loyalhannan,
to which point Armstrong and St.
Clair pushed the road-building. Washington
himself supervised the cutting of
Forbes&rsquo;s road westward from Fort Ligonier
toward Fort Duquesne. Much as he had
wrangled with Bouquet as to the propriety
of making a new road he was as good as
his word and worked heroically for its
success. Never, even in Braddock&rsquo;s death-trap
on the Monongahela, did he come
nearer giving his life to his country.
Forbes&rsquo;s first check came when Grant&rsquo;s
command, sent forward from Fort Ligonier
to reconnoitre Fort Duquesne, was cut to
pieces on Grant&rsquo;s Hill within sight of the
French fort. Eight hundred men went on
the expedition; two hundred and seventy-three
were killed, wounded, or captured.
Bouquet reported the disaster to Forbes on
the seventeenth of September, upon which
the sad man &ldquo;deeply touched by this
reverse,&rdquo; writes Parkman, &ldquo;yet expressed
himself with a moderation that does him
honor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your letter of the seventeenth
I read with no less surprise than concern,
as I could not believe that such an attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
would have been made without my knowledge
and concurrence. The breaking in
upon our fair and flattering hopes of success
touches me most sensibly. There are
two wounded highland officers just now
arrived, who give so lame an account of
the matter that one can draw nothing from
them, only that my friend Grant most certainly
lost his wits, and by his thirst of
fame brought on his own perdition, and
ran great risk of ours.&rdquo; The brave generosity
of these words is not so significant
as the fact that this pain-racked man, far
behind on the road, had such a grasp of the
minutest detail of the whole campaign that
Bouquet, he believed, would not even send
out a scouting party in force without his
&ldquo;knowledge and concurrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A letter from Forbes to Bouquet dated
Reastown, September 23rd, contains some
interesting paragraphs: &ldquo;The description
of the roads is so various and disagreeable
that I do not know what to think or say.
Lieutenant Evans came down here the
other day, and described Laurell Hill as,
at present, impracticable, but he said he
could mend it with the assistance of 500<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
men, fascines and fagots, in one day&rsquo;s time.
Col. Stephens writes Col. Washington that
he is told by everybody that the road from
Loyal Hannon to the Ohio and the French
fort is now impracticable. For what reason,
or why, he writes thus I do not know;
but I see Col. Washington and my friend,
Col. Byrd, would rather be glad this was
true than otherways, seeing the other road
(their favourite scheme) was not followed
out. I told them plainly that, whatever
they thought, yet I did aver that, in our
prosecuting the present road, we had proceeded
from the best intelligence that could
be got for the good and convenience of the
army, without any views to oblige any one
province or another; and added that those
two gentlemen were the only people that
I had met with who had shewed their weakness
in their attachment to the province they
belong to, by declaring so publickly in
favour of one road without their knowing
anything of the other, having never heard
from any Pennsylvania person one word
about the road; and that, as for myself, I
could safely say&mdash;and believed I might
answer for you&mdash;that the good of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
service was the only view we had at heart,
not valuing the provincial interest, jealousys,
or suspicions, one single two-pence;
and that, therefore, I could not believe Col.
Stephen&rsquo;s descriptions untill I had heard
from you, which I hope you will very soon
be able to disprove. I fancy what I have
said more on this subject will cure them
from coming upon this topic again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forbes&rsquo;s next check was more ominous
than Grant&rsquo;s scrimmage. It was not administered
by the French&mdash;though they
followed up the decisive victory on Grant&rsquo;s
Hill with various attacks in force upon Fort
Ligonier&mdash;but by the clouded heavens.
A wet autumn set in early as if to make
St. Clair&rsquo;s road doubly &ldquo;diabolical.&rdquo;
Forbes wrote Bouquet on October 15:
&ldquo;Your Description of the roads pierces me
to the very soul yet still my hopes are that
a few Dry days would make things wear a
more favourable aspect as all Clay Countries
are either good or bad for Carriages
according to the wet or dry season. It is
true we cannot surmount impossibilities
nor prevent unforseen accidents but it must
be a comfort both to you and I still that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
proceeded w<sup>t</sup> Caution in the choice of this
road and in the opinion of every Disinterested
man, it had every advantage over the
other. And I am not sure but it has so still
considering the Yachiogeny &amp; Monongehela
rivers&mdash;so I beg y<sup>t</sup> you will without taking
notice to any body make yourself master of
the arguments for and objections against
the two roads so that upon comparison one
may Judge how far we have been in the
right in our Choice. N. B. If any party
goes out after the Enemy they ought to
have instructions always with regard to the
roads forward as likewise ye Communication
twixt Loyalhana and the nearest part
of M<sup>r</sup> Braddocks road which want of all
things to be reconnoitred in order to stop
foolish mouths if it chances to prove anyways
as good or practicable. May not such
a communication be found without crossing
Laurel hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are exceedingly interesting words
when we know that failure stared Forbes
in the face. This might mean official
inquiry or court martial; in such a case
there would have been, no doubt, question
raised as to the &ldquo;right&rdquo; of Forbes&rsquo;s and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Bouquet&rsquo;s &ldquo;choice.&rdquo; But the fact that
Forbes desired to know the exact condition
of Braddock&rsquo;s Road, to get into it if it
seemed best, and to prove the soundness of
his judgment if it was found to be useless,
is especially significant because it shows so
plainly that the weary man already scented
failure. In a few days he wrote again:
&ldquo;These four days of constant rain have
completely ruined the road. The wagons
would cut it up more in an hour than we
could repair in a week. I have written to
General Abercrombie, but have not had one
scrap of a pen from him since the beginning
of September; so it looks as if we
were either forgot or left to our fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in November the poor man was
carried on over the mountains to Fort Ligonier
where the whole army, approximately
six thousand strong, lay. Hope of continuing
the campaign had fled and the
desperate prospect of wintering amid the
mountains, with no certainty of receiving
sufficient stores to keep man and beast alive,
stared the whole army in the face. Nevertheless,
at a council of officers it was decided
to attempt nothing further that season.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few hours three prisoners were
brought into camp who reported the true
condition of affairs at Fort Duquesne.
Bradstreet had destroyed the stores destined
for the Ohio by the destruction of Fort
Frontenac. Ligneris, the commandant,
had consequently been compelled to send
home his Illinois and Louisiana militia.
The brave Post had succeeded in alienating
the Ohio Indians. The remainder at Fort
Duquesne were glad now to hurry away
into their winter quarters in their distant
homelands. The gods had favored the
brave.</p>

<p>Immediately Forbes determined upon a
hurried advance with a picked body of
twenty-five hundred men, unencumbered.
Washington and Armstrong hastened
ahead to cut the pathway. A strong vanguard
led the way. Behind them came
the hero of the hour and of the campaign,
Forbes, borne on his litter. The Highlanders
occupied the center of the rear,
with the Royal Americans and provincials
on their right and left under Bouquet and
Washington. On the night of the twenty-fourth
the little army lay on its arms in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
hills of Turkey Creek, near Braddock&rsquo;s
fatal field. At midnight a booming report
startled them. Were the French welcoming
the long-expected re&euml;nforcements from
Presque Isle and Niagara&mdash;or had a magazine
exploded? In the morning some
advised a delay to reconnoitre. Forbes
scorned the suggestion; &ldquo;I will sleep,&rdquo; he
is said to have exclaimed, &ldquo;in Fort Duquesne
or in hell tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dusk that November evening the
army marched breathlessly down the wide,
hard trace over which Beaujeu had led his
rabble toward Braddock&rsquo;s army and, without
opposition, came at last within sight of
the goal upon which the eyes of the world
had been directed so long. The barracks
and store-house of Fort Duquesne were
burned, the fortifications blown up and the
French&mdash;gone forever.</p>

<p>Two days later a weary man sat within
an improvised house and with a feeble hand
indited a letter to the British Secretary of
State. And all it contained was summed
up in its first words: &ldquo;Pittsbourgh 27<sup>th</sup>
Novem<sup>r</sup> 1758.&rdquo; It was Pitt&rsquo;s bourgh now.
The region about the junction of the Alle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>gheny
and Monongahela was known in
Kentucky as &ldquo;the Pitt country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The generous Bouquet expressed the
sentiment of the army when he affirmed:
&ldquo;After God, the success of this expedition
is entirely due to the General.&rdquo; When
Forbes&rsquo;s physical condition is understood,
his last campaign must be considered one
of the most heroic in the annals of America.
&ldquo;Its solid value was above price. It opened
the Great West to English enterprise, took
from France half her savage allies, and relieved
the western borders from the scourge
of Indian war. From southern New York
to North Carolina, the frontier populations
had cause to bless the memory of the steadfast
and all-enduring soldier.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Forbes soon became unable to write or
dictate a letter. On the terrible return
journey over his freshly-hewn road he
suffered intensely, sometimes losing consciousness.
He was carried the entire
distance to Philadelphia on his litter, and
in March he died. His body, at last free
from pain, was laid with befitting honors
in the chancel of Christ Church.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The following death notice and appreciation
of General Forbes appeared in the
Pennsylvania <i>Gazette</i> March 15, 1759:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Sunday last, died, of a tedious
illness, John Forbes, Esq., in the 49th year
of his age, son to &mdash;&mdash; Forbes, Esq., of
Petmerief, in the Shire of Fife, in Scotland,
Brigadier General, Colonel of the
17th Regiment of North America; a gentleman
generally known and esteemed, and
most sincerely and universally regretted.
In his younger days he was bred to the
profession of physic, but, early ambitious
of the military character, he purchased into
the Regiment of <i>Scott&rsquo;s Grey Dragoons</i>,
where, by repeated purchases and faithful
services, he arrived to the rank of Lieutenant
Colonel. His superior abilities soon
recommended him to the protection of General
Campbell, the Earl of Stair, Duke of
Bedford, Lord Ligonier, and other distinguished
characters in the army; with some
of them as an aid; with the rest in the
familiarity of a family man. During the
last war he had the honor to be employed
in the post of Quarter-Master General, in
the army under his Royal Highness, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Duke, which duty he discharged with
accuracy, dignity and dispatch. His services
in America are well known. By a
steady pursuit of well-concerted measures,
in defiance of disease and numberless
obstructions, he brought to a happy issue
a most extraordinary campaign, and made
a willing sacrifice of his own life to what
he valued more&mdash;the interests of his king
and country. As a man he was just and
without prejudices; brave, without ostentation;
uncommonly warm in his friendships,
and incapable of flattery; acquainted with
the world and mankind, he was well-bred,
but absolutely impatient of formality and
affectation. As an officer, he was quick to
discern useful men and useful measures,
generally seeing both at first view, according
to their real qualities; steady in his
measures, and open to information and
council; in command he had dignity without
superciliousness; and though perfectly
master of the forms, never hesitated to drop
them, when the spirit and more essential
parts of the service required it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE MILITARY ROAD TO THE WEST</h3>


<p>There is another hero of Forbes&rsquo;s
Road. The rough days of that
summer of 1758 were only suggestions
of what was to come. Other armies
than that of Forbes were to pass this way,
for, be it understood at once, Forbes&rsquo;s
Road became the great military highway
into the West. No single road in America
witnessed so many campaigns; no road in
America was fortified by such a chain of
forts. For a generation this route from
Lancaster by Carlisle, Bedford, Ligonier to
Pittsburg was the most important thoroughfare
to the West.</p>

<p>The French retired from Fort Duquesne,
down the Ohio and up the Allegheny.
The remainder of the war was fought far
away on the St. Lawrence. Hardly a shot
was fired in the West after the skirmishes
at Fort Ligonier succeeding Grant&rsquo;s defeat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
The French at Venango and Detroit made
light of Forbes&rsquo;s occupation of Fort Duquesne.
They had retired voluntarily and
swore to return in the spring. In a dozen
western posts the French bragged still of
their possession of the West and of their
future conquests. The Indians believed
each boast.</p>

<p>In the next year&rsquo;s campaign Quebec fell.
New France passed away, and all French
territory east of the Mississippi, save only
a fishing station on the island of Newfoundland
came into the hands of the
English. But this campaign was fought in
the far northeast. Of it the West and its
redskinned inhabitants knew nothing. Fort
Niagara was the most westerly fort which
had succumbed; Fort Duquesne, technically,
was evacuated. The real story of the
successive French defeats was, perhaps,
little heard of in the West; or, if communicated
to the Indian allies there, the logical
conclusion was not plain to them. How
could a land be conquered where not a single
battle had been fought? So far as the Indians
were concerned, France was never more in
possession of their western lakes and forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
than then. Was not the blundering Braddock
killed and his fine army utterly put to
rout? Were not the French forts in the
West&mdash;Presque Isle, Venango, Le B&#339;uf,
Miami, and Detroit, secure? Fort Duquesne
could be reoccupied whenever the
French would give the signal. The leaden
plates of France still reposed at the mouths
of the rivers of the West and the Arms of
the King of France still rattled in the wind
which swept the land.</p>

<p>Fancy the surprise of the Indians, then,
when little parties of redcoat soldiers came
into the West, and, with quiet insolence,
took possession of the French forts and of
the Indian&rsquo;s land! And the French moved
neither hand nor foot to oppose them,
though through so many years they had
boasted their prowess, and though ten
Wyandots could have done so successfully.
Detroit was surrendered to a mere corporal&rsquo;s
guard, and the lesser forts to a
sentry&rsquo;s watch each. It remained for the
newcomers to inform the Indians of the
events which led to the changing of the
flags on these inland fortresses&mdash;to tell
them that the French armies had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
utterly overwhelmed, and the French capital
captured, and French rule in America
at an end.</p>

<p>But these explanations, given glibly, no
doubt, by arrogant English officers, were
repeated over and over by the Indians, and
slowly, before a hundred, yea, a thousand
dim fires in the forests. We can believe
it was not all plain to them, this sudden
conquest of a country where hardly a battle
had been fought for eight years, and that
battle the greatest victory ever achieved
by the red man. Perhaps messengers were
sent back to the forts to gain, casually,
additional information concerning this
marvelous conquest by proxy. French
traders, as ignorant, or feigning to be, as
the Indians, were implored to explain
the sudden forgetfulness of the French
&ldquo;Father&rdquo; of the Indians.</p>

<p>It was inexplicable. The news spread
rapidly: &ldquo;The French have surrendered
our land to the English.&rdquo; Fierce Shawanese
around their fires at Chillicothe on
the Scioto heard the news, and sullenly
passed it on westward to the Miamis, and
eastward to the angered Delawares on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Muskingum, who had now forgotten Frederick
Post. The Senecas on the upper
Allegheny heard the news. The Ottawas
and Wyandots on both sides of the Detroit
River heard it&mdash;and before the fires of each
of these fierce French-loving Indian nations
there was much silence while chieftains
pondered, and the few words uttered were
stern and cruel.</p>

<p>Cruel words grew to angry threats. By
what right, the chieftains asked, could the
French surrender the Black Forest to the
English? When did the French come to
own the land, after all? They were the
guests, the friends of the Indian&mdash;not his
conquerors. The French built forts, it is
true, but they were for the Indian as well
as for the French, and were forts in name
only, and the more of them the merrier!
But now a conqueror had come, telling the
Indian the land was no longer his, but
belonged to the British king.</p>

<p>Threats soon grew into visible form.
Where it started is not surely known&mdash;some
say from the Senecas on the upper
Allegheny&mdash;but soon a fearful Bloody Belt
went on a journey with its terrible sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>mons
to war. It passed to the Delawares
and to the Shawanese and Miamis and
Wyandots, and where it went the death
halloo sounded through the forests. The
call was to the Indians of the Black Forest
to rise and cast out the English from the
land. If the French could not have it, certainly
no one else should. The dogs of
war were loosened. The young warriors
of the Allegheny and Muskingum and
Scioto and Miami and Detroit danced wildly
before the fires, and the old men sang their
half-forgotten war chants.</p>

<p>The terrible war which in 1763 burst
over the West has never been paralleled by
savages the world over in point of swift
success. This may be attributed to the
fact that a leader was found in Pontiac, a
chieftain in the Ottawa nation, who for
daring and intelligence was never matched
by a man of his race. He had the courage
of sweeping and patriotic convictions. He
saw in the English occupation of the land
the doom of the red man. Indeed he must
have seen it before, but if so he had not had
an opportunity to put his convictions to a
public test. The Indian was becoming a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
changed man. The implements and utensils
of the white man were adopted by the
red. The independent forest arts of their
fathers were beginning to be forgotten.
Kettles and blankets and powder and lead
were taking the place of the wooden bowls
and fur robes and swift flint heads. In
another generation the art of making a
living for himself in the forest would be
forgotten by the Indian, and he would
henceforth be absolutely dependent upon
the foreigner. All this Pontiac saw. He
felt commissioned to lead a return to
nature. The arts of the white man must
be discarded and the Indians must come
back to their primitive mode of living in
dependence upon their own skill and
ingenuity.</p>

<p>And so Pontiac waged a religious war.
At a great convention of the savages he
told them that a Delaware Indian had,
while lost in the forests, been guided into
a path which led to the home of the Great
Spirit, and, on coming there, had been
upbraided by the Master of Life himself
for the degenerate state to which his
race was falling. The forest arts of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
fathers must be encouraged and relied
upon. The utensils of the white man must
be banished from the wigwams. Bows and
arrows and tomahawks and stone hatchets
should not be discarded. Otherwise the
Great Spirit would take away their land
from them and give it to others. And so,
much of the fury which accompanied the
war was a sort of religious frenzy. &ldquo;The
Master of Life himself has stirred us up,&rdquo;
said the warriors.</p>

<p>Pontiac&rsquo;s plot&mdash;undoubtedly the most
comprehensive military campaign ever conceived
in redman&rsquo;s brain&mdash;was discovered
by the British at Fort Miami, on the Maumee
River, in March 1763, four years after
the fall of Quebec. There the Bloody Belt
was found and secured before it could be
forwarded to the Wabash with its murderous
message. By threats and warnings the
untutored English officers thought to quell
the disturbance. Amherst, his Majesty&rsquo;s
commanding general in America, haughtily
condemned the signs of revolution as &ldquo;unwarranted.&rdquo;
Moreover he gave his officers
in the West authority to declare to the
Indian chieftains that if they should con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>spire
they would in his eyes, make &ldquo;a
contemptible figure!&rdquo; Time passed and
the garrisons breathed easily as quiet
reigned.</p>

<p>It was but the lull before the storm.
On the seventh of May, Pontiac, who led
his Ottawas at Braddock&rsquo;s defeat, appeared
before Detroit, the metropolis of the northwest,
with three hundred warriors. The
watchfulness of the brave Major Gladwin,
a well-trained pupil in that school on Braddock&rsquo;s
Road, and the failure of Pontiac to
capture the fort by strategy, though his
warriors were admitted within its walls and
had shortened guns concealed beneath their
blankets, was the dramatic beginning of a
reign of terror and a war of devastation all
the way from Sault St. Marie to even
beyond the crest of the Alleghenies. Pontiac
immediately invested Detroit and
throughout the Black Forest his faithful
allies did their Ottawa chieftain&rsquo;s will.
On the sixteenth of May, Fort Sandusky
was surrounded by Indians seemingly
friendly. The British commander permitted
seven to enter. As they sat smoking,
by the turn of a head the signal was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
given and the commander was a prisoner.
As he was hurried out of the fort he saw,
here one dead soldier, there another&mdash;victims
of the massacre. Nine days later
a band of Indians appeared before the fort
at the mouth of the St. Joseph. &ldquo;We are
come to see our relatives,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and
wish the garrison good morning.&rdquo; Within
two minutes after their entrance the commanding
officer and three men were prisoners
and eleven others were murdered. Two
days later the commander of Fort Miami,
on the Maumee River, came, at an Indian
girl&rsquo;s pitiful plea, to the Indian village to
bleed a sick child. He was shot in his
tracks. Four days later the commander of
Fort Ouatianon, on the Wabash, was
inveigled into an Indian cabin and captured,
the fort surrendering forthwith. Two days
later Indians gathered at Fort Michilimackinac
to engage in a game of lacrosse. At
the height of the contest the ball was
thrown near a gate of the fort. In the
twinkling of an eye the commanding officer
who stood watching the game was seized,
and the Indians, snatching tomahawks from
under the blankets of squaws who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
standing in proper position, entered the
fort and killed fifteen soldiers outright
and took the remainder of the garrison
prisoners.</p>

<p>Sixteen days later Fort Le B&#339;uf, on
French Creek, where Washington delivered
his message to the haughty St. Pierre a
decade before, was attacked by an overwhelming
army of savages. Keeping the
enemy off until midnight, the garrison
made good its escape, unknown to the
exultant besiegers who had already fired
one corner bastion, and fled down the river
to Fort Pitt. On their way they passed the
smouldering ruins of Fort Venango. Two
days later Fort Presque Isle was attacked.
In two days the commander, senseless with
terror, struck his flag. The same day Fort
Ligonier on Forbes&rsquo;s Road was invested
by a besieging army.</p>

<p>Thus the campaign of Pontiac, prosecuted
with such swiftness and such success, bade
fair to end in triumph. &ldquo;We hate the
English,&rdquo; the Indians sent word to the
French on the Mississippi, &ldquo;and wish to
kill them. We are all united: the war is
our war, and we will continue it for seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
years. The English shall never come into
the West!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt stood firm.
For months Pontiac beleaguered the northern
fortress, gaining advantages whenever
the garrison attacked him, but unable to
reduce the fort. All summer long the eyes
of the world were upon Detroit; and the
gallant defense of Fort Pitt, was, comparatively,
forgotten. But the maintenance of
this strategic point was of incalculable
importance to the West. The garrison felt
this. And here, if anywhere, was courage
shown in battle. Here, if ever, brave men
faced fearful odds with unshaken courage
worthy of their Saxon blood.</p>

<p>In planning his campaign Pontiac delegated
the Shawanese and Delawares to
carry Fort Pitt. If they could not do it he
might be assured that the position was
impregnable. They were his most reliable
warriors, and, once given the task of carrying
out the second most important <i>coup</i> of
their great leader&rsquo;s plan, could be trusted
to use any alternative savage lust could
suggest, or trick savage cunning could
invent in order to accomplish their portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of the terrible conquest of the West. The
defense of Detroit was brave; but Detroit
was on the great water highway east and
west. Succor was possible, in fact probable,
in time; if not, there was a way of
escape. At Fort Pitt could either be
expected? The only approach to it was
this indifferent roadway hewn westward
from Bedford in 1758. Moreover the fort
had never been completed. On three sides
the flood tides of the rivers had injured it.
Ecuyer, its valiant defender, threw up a
rough rampart of logs and palisaded the
interior. And in this fragile fortress,
hardly worthy of the name, behind which
lay the darkling Alleghenies and about
which loomed the Black Forest, were gathered
some six hundred souls, a larger
community, probably, than the total population
of Detroit. And around on every
side were gathered the lines of ochred
warriors preparing for another charge even
to the very blood-bespattered walls. The
garrison might well have believed itself
beyond the reach of succor, if indeed
succor could avail before need of it had
vanished. The bones of Braddock&rsquo;s seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
hundred slain lay scattered about the forests
only seven miles away. Could another
army come again? Little wonder that the
Shawanese and Delawares were already
flushed with victory as they renewed their
unavailing attacks.</p>

<p>The task of relieving Fort Pitt was
placed upon the tried shoulders of Colonel
Henry Bouquet, whose brilliant services in
Forbes&rsquo;s campaign have been fully described.
Amherst, then commanding in
America, sent him the remains of the
Forty-second and Seventy-seventh regiments,
which amounted to the pitiful total
of three hundred and forty-seven men and
officers; concerning additional troops Amherst
was painfully plain: &ldquo;Should the
whole race of Indians take arms against us
I can do no more.&rdquo; Recruits joined the
army as it moved along through Lancaster
and Carlisle, which augmented the force
slightly.</p>

<p>But the brave Bouquet, with an army
not exceeding five hundred men, set out
westward from Bedford on the rough road
he himself had made with the vanguard of
the &ldquo;Head of Iron&rdquo; five years before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
The appalling condition in which he found
the country along the border would have
daunted a less bold man. Every fort from
Lake Erie to the Ohio had been razed to
the ground. The whole country was panic-stricken.
Houses were left vacant or
burned, together with crops, and the mountain
roads were blocked with fugitives, half
famished, who threw themselves upon the
intrepid Bouquet at his camps. It was
indeed a trying time, a time for such a
man as Bouquet to show himself.</p>

<p>Never did the success of a campaign in
the history of war depend more on the
sagacity, bravery, and personal knowledge
of a single commanding officer. This daring
Swiss was everywhere and everything.
He knew that the enemy, though they
retired before him even as he approached
Fort Ligonier, were watching every movement
of the coming army. He knew they
were cognizant of his weakness, the debility
of his men, the lack of provision, the
paucity of scouts and spies. He knew, and
so did the silent, lurking spies of the
enemy, that Braddock&rsquo;s slain outnumbered
his whole force.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ligonier&mdash;named by Bouquet himself
from a warrior whose bravery was now
his inspiration&mdash;was not a place to pause,
though just beyond lay the death-trap
where Aubrey had defeated the ill-fated
Grant five years before. On he went.
As the inevitable battle-ground was neared
Bouquet redoubled his watchfulness.
When a darker defile than usual was
reached, with a rifle across his lap, the
commander went forward and himself led
the army&rsquo;s van into it.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fifth of August
tents were struck early and another day&rsquo;s
march commenced. Over broken country
enveloped in forests the army went its
way. By one o&rsquo;clock they had made seventeen
miles and were not less than half a
mile from Bushy Run, their proposed
camping place. Suddenly was heard the
report of rifle fire in front. As the main
army listened the noise quickened to a
sharp rattle&mdash;and the decisive battle of
Bushy Run was commenced.</p>

<p>The two foremost companies were
ordered forward to support the vanguard
now hotly engaged. This causing no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
abatement, the convoy was halted and a
general charge formed. By an onward
rush, with fixed bayonets, Bouquet and his
eager men cleared the field. But firing on
the right and left and in the rear announced
that both flanks and the convoy were simultaneously
attacked. An order was given
to fall back. This having been executed,
an unbroken circle was formed about the
terrified horses.</p>

<p>Though in number the combatants were
nearly equal, the savages had all the
advantage of a superior force fighting
under cover. Bouquet&rsquo;s army, like Braddock&rsquo;s,
was in the open. With furious
cries accompanied by a heavy fire, the
Indians attempted to break the iron circle.
And they fought with sly cunning. Not
waiting to receive the answering attacks,
they leaped behind the nearest trees, only
to come back to the attack with increased
ferocity from another quarter. The English
suffered severely while the active
Indians, under cover, were almost untouched.
Nothing but implicit confidence
in Bouquet could have inspired this little
army with the steadiness it displayed. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
one lost composure. Each man knew they
could not retreat or advance&mdash;fight they
must and fight they surely did.</p>

<p>Night came, and under cover of the darkness
the wearied soldiers cared for the
wounded. Placed in the cleared center of
the circle, a rude wall of sacks of flour
was built around them. Here, enduring
agonies of thirst, for not a drop of water
could be obtained, they lay listening to the
fiendish yells of the enemy&mdash;a poor cure
for wounds and burning thirst.</p>

<p>When the necessary arrangements for
the night had been completed and provision
made against a night attack, Bouquet,
doubtful of surviving the morrow&rsquo;s battle,
wrote to Sir Jeffrey Amherst a brief and
concise account of the day&rsquo;s fight. His
report ends with these words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;... As, in case of another engagement,
I fear insurmountable, difficulties in
protecting and transporting our provisions,
being already so much weakened by the
losses of this day, in men and horses,
besides the additional necessity of carrying
the wounded, whose situation is truly
deplorable.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Even before morning light, the beastly,
impatient cries of the Indians began to be
heard on every side, soon accompanied by
a deadly fire. As on the preceding day
the return fire had little effect, for the savages
silently vanished at the gleam of
leveled bayonets. But at ten o&rsquo;clock the
ring remained unbroken though the troops
were already fatigued and were now crazed
by torments of thirst, &ldquo;more intolerable
than the enemy&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo; The horses, often
struck and completely terrified, now broke
away by scores and madly galloped up and
down the neighboring hills. The ranks
were constantly thinning. It was plain to
all that a decisive and immediate bold
stroke must be made.</p>

<p>The commander was equal to the emergency!
The confidence of the foe had
grown so overbearing that Bouquet determined
to stake everything upon the very
recklessness of his enemies. The portion
of the circle which immediately fronted the
Indians, and which was composed of light
infantry, was ordered to feign retreat. As
this movement was accomplished, a thin
line of men was thrown across the deserted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
position from the sides, drawing in close
to the convoy. Thinking this to be a
retreat, which the new line had been summoned
to cover, the Indians, with cutting
screams, jumped out from every side and
rushed headlong toward the centre of the
circle. Then, suddenly upon their rear
poured the light infantry, which had made
a marvelous detour through the woods.
With a frightful bayonet charge and with
highland yells as piercing as those of the
Indians, the grenadiers, flushed with victory,
drove the terrified savages through
the forests. In the twinkling of an eye the
outcries of the savages ceased altogether
and not a living foe remained. Sixty
Indian corpses lay scattered about the
camp. Only one captive was taken and he
was riddled with English bullets. The
loss of the English amounted to eight
officers and one hundred and fifteen men.
This was the first English victory over the
Indians of the central West. Fort Necessity,
Braddock&rsquo;s Field, and Grant&rsquo;s Hill
were now avenged. It was a late victory
but was far better late than never. Fort
Pitt was relieved.</p>

<p>What Forbes&rsquo;s Road was to Pittsburg
and the West in the Old French War and
in Pontiac&rsquo;s Rebellion it was in the Revolutionary
days, 1775-83. For thirty years
after it was built it was the main highway
across the mountains. It is impossible to
estimate the worth of this straight roadway
to the Ohio; had Forbes followed Braddock&rsquo;s
Road to Fort Pitt, western travel
ever after would have been at the mercy
of the two rivers, the Youghiogheny and
Monongahela, which that road crosses. In
the winter months it would have been difficult,
if not impossible, to have kept open
communication between a line of forts and
blockhouses on Braddock&rsquo;s Road. This
was done on Forbes&rsquo;s Road throughout the
half century of conflict.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Revolutionary
War, the continental war office being at
Philadelphia, Forbes&rsquo;s Road became more
strategic than ever in its history. It was
now known as the &ldquo;Pennsylvania Road,&rdquo;
and was the direct route to the military
center of the West, Fort Pitt. Braddock&rsquo;s
Road&mdash;now known as the &ldquo;Virginia
Road&rdquo;&mdash;was the main route from Vir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ginia
and Maryland. In the dispute
between Virginia and Pennsylvania for
the region of which Fort Pitt was the
center, the two routes thither were the
avenues of the two contending factions.
With the drowning of this quarrel in the
momentous struggle precipitated in 1775,
Forbes&rsquo;s Road at once became pre&euml;minently
important. Cattle and goods were
frequently sent over Braddock&rsquo;s Road as
far as Brownsville and forwarded by
water to Fort Pitt and the American forts
on the Ohio. But far greater was the
activity on Forbes&rsquo;s Road. Forts Bedford
and Ligonier, and a score of fortified
cabins at such points as Turtle Creek,
Sewickly, Bullock Pens, Widow Myers,
Proctors, Brush Run, Reyburn&rsquo;s, and Hannastown
served to guard the main thoroughfare
to the Ohio. Between these
points scouts were continually hurrying,
and over the narrow roadway passed the
wagons and pack-horses laden with ammunition
and stores. Hannastown and Ligonier
became the important <i>entrep&ocirc;ts</i> between
Carlisle and Fort Pitt in the Revolution.
Carlisle was the important eastern depot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of troops and ammunition from which both
eastern and western commanders received
supplies.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Garrisons along the Pennsylvania
Road were ordered at the close of the
war to report at Carlisle for their pay.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Hannastown, thirty miles east of Fort Pitt
and three miles northeast of the present
Greensburg, was the first collection of huts
on the Pennsylvania Road between Bedford
and Pittsburg dignified by the name
of a town. At the breaking out of the
Revolution it was the most important settlement
in all Westmoreland County save
only those about Forts Pitt and Ligonier.
&ldquo;These huts scattered along the narrow
pack-horse track among the monster trees
of the ancient forest, was that Hannastown,
which occupied such a prominent
place in the early history of Western
Pennsylvania where was held the first
court west of the Alleghany where the
resolves of May 16, 1775, were passed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
From this rude little cluster of huts on
Forbes&rsquo;s Road, deep in the Allegheny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
mountains, came one of the first and most
spirited protests against British tyranny.
From such sparks the flames of revolution
were soon fanned. Hannastown &ldquo;was
burned last Saturday afternoon,&rdquo; wrote
General Irvine to Secretary of War Lincoln,
July 16, 1782; &ldquo;... that place is
about thirty-five miles in the rear of Fort
Pitt, on the main road leading to Philadelphia,
generally called the Pennsylvania
[Forbes&rsquo;s] road. The Virginia [Braddock&rsquo;s]
road is yet open, but how long it will
continue so is uncertain, as this stroke has
alarmed the whole country beyond conception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In winter the road was almost impassable;
Brodhead wrote Richard Peters: &ldquo;The
great Depth of Snow upon the Alleghany
and Laurel Hills have prevented our Getting
every kind of Stores, nor do I expect
to get any now until the latter End of
April.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> General Irvine wrote his wife
January 8, 1782: &ldquo;If the road was fit for
sleighing I could now go down (to Carlisle)
snugly, but it is quite impracticable; it is
barely passable on horseback.&rdquo; Fort Pitt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
was invariably supplied with regular troops
from Lancaster or Carlisle, which marched
over the Pennsylvania Road.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<h3>THE PENNSYLVANIA ROAD</h3>


<p>Such had become the importance of the
Pennsylvania Road that, soon after
the Revolutionary struggle, Pennsylvania
took active steps to improve it. On
the twenty-first day of September an act of
the Assembly of Pennsylvania gave birth
to the great thoroughfare at first called
&ldquo;The Western Road to Pittsburg,&rdquo; and
familiarly known since as the Pittsburg or
the Chambersburg-Pittsburg Pike.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This
state road was, as heretofore recorded, one
hundred and ninety-seven miles in length
from Carlisle to Pittsburg. The road built
in 1785-87 follows practically the course of
the present highway between the same
points. Here and there the traveler may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
see the olden track a few rods distant on
his right or left; at points it lies several
miles to the south. The present Pittsburg
Pike passes through Greensburg, while old
Hannastown on Forbes&rsquo;s Road lies three
miles to the northwest. The old route was
a little less careful as to hills than the
new, and made a straighter line across the
country; the telephone companies have
taken advantage of this and send their
wires along the easily discerned track of
the old road at many points. There is no
point perhaps where the old road of 1785 is
so plainly to be remarked as on the side of
the upper end of Long Hollow Run, Napier
township, Bedford County, a few miles
west of historic little Bedford.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Road and its important
branch, the &ldquo;Turkey Foot&rdquo; Road to
the Youghiogheny, became one of the important
highways to the Ohio basin in the
pioneer era. With the digging of the
Pennsylvania canal up the valley of the
Juniata, the Pennsylvania Road became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
less important until it became what it is
today, a merely local thoroughfare. For
the last two decades in the eighteenth
century, the Pennsylvania Road held a
pre&euml;minent position&mdash;days when a good
road westward meant everything to the
West. But the road could never be again
what it was in the savage days of &rsquo;58, &rsquo;63
and &rsquo;75-&rsquo;82, when it was the one fortified
route to the Ohio. The need for Forbes&rsquo;s
Road passed when Forts Loudoun, Bedford,
Ligonier, and Pitt were demolished. While
they were standing, the open pathway
between them meant everything to their
defenders and to the farmers and woodsmen
about them. But it meant almost as much
to the fortresses far beyond in the wilderness
of the Ohio Valley&mdash;Forts McIntosh,
Patrick Henry, Harmar, Finney, and Washington.
The vast proportion of stores and
ammunition for the defenders of the Black
Forest of the West passed over Forbes&rsquo;s
Road, and its story is linked more closely
than we can now realize with the occupation
and the winning of the West.</p>

<p>Mr. McMaster has an interesting paragraph
on Forbes&rsquo;s Road in pioneer days:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;From Philadelphia ran out a road to what
was then the far West. Its course after
leaving the city lay through the counties
of Chester and Lancaster, then sparsely
settled, now thick with towns and cities
and penetrated with innumerable railways,
and went over the Blue Ridge mountains to
Shippensburg and the little town of Bedford.
Thence it wound through the beautiful
hills of western Pennsylvania, and
crossed the Alleghany mountains to the
head-waters of the Ohio. It was known to
travelers as the northern route, and was
declared to be execrable. In reality it was
merely a passable road, broad and level in
the lowlands, narrow and dangerous in the
passes of the mountains, and beset with
steep declivities. Yet it was the chief
highway between the Mississippi valley
and the East, and was constantly travelled
in the summer months by thousands of
emigrants to the western country, and by
long trains of wagons bringing the produce
of the little farms on the banks of the Ohio
to the markets of Philadelphia and Baltimore.
In any other section of the country
a road so frequented would have been con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>sidered
as eminently pleasant and safe.
But some years later the traveler who was
forced to make the journey from Philadelphia
to Pittsburg in his carriage and four,
beheld with dread the cloud of dust which
marked the slow approach of a train of
wagons. For nothing excited the anger of
the sturdy teamsters more than the sight
of a carriage. To them it was the unmistakable
mark of aristocracy, and they were
indeed in a particularly good humor when
they suffered the despised vehicle to draw
up by the road-side without breaking the
shaft, or taking off the wheels, or tumbling
it over into the ditch. His troubles over,
the traveler found himself at a small hamlet,
then known as Pittsburg.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Forbes&rsquo;s Road, strictly speaking, began
at Bedford, as Braddock&rsquo;s Road began at
Cumberland. In these pages the main
route from Philadelphia&mdash;the Pennsylvania
Road&mdash;has been considered under
the head of Forbes&rsquo;s Road. The eastern
extremity of this thoroughfare, or the portion,
sixty-six miles in length, between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Philadelphia and Lancaster, became the
first macadamized road in the United States
and demands particular attention in another
volume of this series<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more surprising
to the writer than to find how remarkably
this road held its own in competition with
the Braddock or the Cumberland Road
south of it. Explain it as you will, nine-tenths
of the published accounts left by
travelers of the old journey from Philadelphia,
Baltimore, or Washington into the
Ohio Valley describe this Pennsylvania
route. The Cumberland Road was built
from Cumberland, Maryland to Wheeling,
West Virginia, on the Ohio (1806-1818) at
a cost of nearly two million dollars, yet
during the entire first half of that century
you will find that almost every important
writer who passed over the mountains went
over the Pennsylvania Road. It is exceedingly
difficult to find a graphic picture of a
journey over Braddock&rsquo;s Road before 1800;
contemporaneous descriptions of a journey
over the Cumberland or National Road are
not numerous. On the other hand a vol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>ume
could be filled with descriptions of the
old Pennsylvania Road through Bedford
and Ligonier. I believe the fame of the
Cumberland Road was due rather to the
fact of its being a national enterprise&mdash;and
the first of its kind on the continent&mdash;than
to any superiority it achieved over
competing routes. The idea of the road
was grand and it played a mighty part in
the advancement of the West; but, such
was the nature of its course, that it does
not seem to have been the &ldquo;popular route&rdquo;
from Washington to Pittsburg, the principal
port on the Ohio River.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Road was the most
important link between New England and
the Ohio Valley in the days when New
England was sending the bravest of its sons
to become the pioneers of the rising empire
in the West. True, Venable has written:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The footsteps of a hundred years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have echoed, since o&rsquo;er Braddock&rsquo;s Road,</span><br />
Bold Putnam and the Pioneers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Led History the way they strode.</span><br />
<br />
&ldquo;On wild Monongahela&rsquo;s stream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They launched the Mayflower of the West,</span><br />
A perfect state their civic dream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A new New World their pilgrim quest.&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>It is due to the Pennsylvania Road, however,
to correct the history of these lofty
strains. Putnam and his pioneers did not
travel one step on Braddock&rsquo;s Road, nor
did they launch their boats on wild Monongahela&rsquo;s
stream. They came over the worn
track of Forbes&rsquo;s Road through Carlisle
and Bedford, proceeding southwest through
the &ldquo;Glades&rdquo; to the Youghiogheny River
at West Newton, Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Braddock&rsquo;s Road would have been exceedingly
roundabout for New England
travelers, as Forbes long before clearly
established. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s new road,
begun in 1785, was not a tempting route
of travel for these New Englanders in this
year, 1788. &ldquo;The roads, at that day,&rdquo;
wrote Dr. Hildreth, &ldquo;across the mountains
were the worst we can imagine&mdash;cut into
deep gullies on one side by mountain rains,
while the other was filled with blocks of
sand stone.... As few of the emigrant
wagons were provided with lock-chains for
the wheels, the downward impetus was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
checked by a large log, or broken tree top,
tied with a rope to the back of the wagon
and dragged along on the ground. In other
places, the road was so sideling that all the
men who could be spared were required to
pull at the side stays, or short ropes attached
to the upper side of the wagons, to prevent
their upsetting.... All this part of the
country, and as far east as Carlisle, had
been, about twenty-five years before,
depopulated by the depredations of the
Indians. Many of the present inhabitants
well remembered those days of trial, and
could not see these helpless women and
children moving so far away into the wilderness
as Ohio, without expressing their
fears.... Three days after ... they
reached the little village of Bedford.
During this period they had crossed &ldquo;Sideling
Hill,&rdquo; forded some of the main
branches of the Juniata, and threaded the
narrow valleys along its borders. Every
few miles long strings of pack-horses met
them on the road, bearing heavy burthens
of peltry and ginseng, the two main articles
of export from the regions west of the
mountains. Others overtook them loaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with kegs of spirits, salt, and bales of dry
goods, on their way to the traders in Pittsburg....
Four miles beyond Bedford,
the road to the right was called the &ldquo;Pittsburg
Road,&rdquo; while that to the left was
called the &ldquo;Glade Road,&rdquo; and led to Simrel&rsquo;s
ferry, on the Yohiogany river. This
was the route of the emigrants....&rdquo;</p>

<p>This imperfect glimpse of these &ldquo;founders
of Ohio&rdquo; toiling over the Pennsylvania
Road in 1788 on their way to Marietta&mdash;the
vanguard of that Ohio Company which
made possible the &ldquo;sublime&rdquo; Ordinance of
1787&mdash;is striking proof that this pathway
was the link between the old and the new
New England.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Road was also a common
route from Baltimore and Washington;
it was Arthur Lee&rsquo;s route to Pittsburg in
1784,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and Col. John May&rsquo;s route from
Baltimore to Pittsburg in 1788.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Francis
Baily, F. R. S., President of the Royal
Astronomical Society of England, was one
of the well-known Englishmen who left a
record of experiences on this pioneer high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>way.
In 1796 this gentleman started upon
a tour from Washington to Pittsburg. He
mentions no other route than the one he
traversed, and it is altogether probable that
he pursued the most popular. On October
7 he left Washington, and, passing through
Fredericktown, Hagerstown, and Chambersburg,
met the Pennsylvania Road at
McConnellstown, and traveled westward on
it to Pittsburg.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> That Mr. Baily pursued
the main route westward there can be no
doubt. An entry in his <i>Journal</i> for October
11 reads: &ldquo;Chambersburg is ... a large
and flourishing place, not inferior to Frederick&rsquo;s-town
or Hagar&rsquo;s-town; being, like
them, on the high road to the western
country, it enjoys all the advantages which
arise from such a continual body of people
as are perpetually emigrating thither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The celebrated Morris Birkbeck, founder
of the English settlement in Illinois, journeyed
from Washington, D.C., to Pittsburg,
in 1817, by way of Frederickstown and
Hagerstown and the Pennsylvania Road.
At &ldquo;McConnell&rsquo;s Town,&rdquo; under the date of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
May 23, he wrote in his journal: &ldquo;The road
we have been travelling [from Washington,
D. C.] terminates at this place, where it
strikes the great turnpike from Philadelphia
to Pittsburg.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Of the scenes about him
Mr. Birkbeck writes:<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> &ldquo;Old America seems
to be breaking up, and moving westward.
We are seldom out of sight, as we travel
on this grand track, towards the Ohio, of
family groups.... To give an idea of
the internal movements of this vast hive,
about 12,000 wagons passed between Baltimore
and Philadelphia, in the last year,
with from four to six, carrying from thirty-five
to forty cwt. The cost of carriage is
about seven dollars per cwt., from Philadelphia
to Pittsburg, and the money paid
for the conveyance of goods on this road,
exceeds &pound;300,000 sterling. Add to these
the numerous stages loaded to the utmost,
and the innumerable travellers, on horseback,
on foot, and in light waggons, and
you have before you a scene of bustle and
business, extending over a space of three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
hundred miles, which is truly wonderful.&rdquo;
Birkbeck does not mention the Cumberland
Road, though it is drawn on the map
accompanying his book. His advice to
prospective immigrants is, in every instance,
to come westward by the Pennsylvania
Road.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>W. Faux, the English farmer who came
to America to examine Birkbeck&rsquo;s scheme
went westward by Braddock&rsquo;s (Cumberland)
Road.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He returned to the East, however,
by the Pennsylvania Road. In examining
the works of a score of English travelers
this was the only one I happened to find
who had gone westward over the Cumberland
Road. Later travelers, as Charles
Augustus Murray, Martineau, and Dickens
passed westward over the Pennsylvania
Canal and incline railway.</p>

<p>No sooner did this northern canal route
and railway rob the Pennsylvania and
Cumberland roads of much business, than
the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, in turn,
took it away from the canal. The building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
of the railway was one of the epoch-making
events in our national history; &ldquo;I consider
this among the most important acts of my
life,&rdquo; affirmed the venerable Charles Carroll,
the Maryland commissioner for the
railway, &ldquo;second only to my signing the
Declaration of Independence, if even it be
second to that.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>For a number of years the Baltimore and
Ohio Railway&mdash;the heir and assign of
Braddock&rsquo;s Road and the famed Cumberland
Road&mdash;was the great avenue of western
movement and progress. But brain
and muscle, even genius, cannot make two
miles one mile. The shortest route across
the continent was, inevitably, to become
the important highway. It must be
remembered that in the early days Philadelphia
was the metropolis of America, and
Baltimore its chief rival. As long as these
cities held the balance of power and trade,
a southerly route to Pittsburg, such as that
of Braddock&rsquo;s Road, then the Cumberland
Road and, finally, the Baltimore and Ohio
Railway would be successful. But with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the vast strides made by New York, the
center of power stole northward until no
route to the Ohio could compete with the
most direct westward line from New York
and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The question then became the same old-time
problem which Forbes met and
decided. The straightest possible line of
communication between Philadelphia and
Pittsburg was equally necessary in 1860
and in 1760. The only difference was that
made necessary by the doing away with
the heavy grades of pioneer roads and
following the water courses.</p>

<p>The result was the Pennsylvania Railroad&mdash;and
its motto is full of significance,
&ldquo;Look at the Map.&rdquo; There is to be found
the secret of its splendid success. The
distance from Philadelphia to Pittsburg on
the Baltimore and Ohio Railway (Connellsville
route) is four hundred and thirty-eight
miles. The distance between Philadelphia
and Pittsburg on the Pennsylvania Railroad
is three hundred and fifty-four miles&mdash;a
saving of eighty-four miles. These railways
do not follow the old highway routes
closely but they mark their general align<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ment
and are frequently close beside them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the map&rdquo; was practically
Forbes&rsquo;s challenge to those who disputed
his judgment a century and a half ago
when he determined to build a straight
road from the heart of the colonies to
the strategic key of the Ohio Valley. His
wisdom has been triumphantly confirmed
in the present generation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> Washington&rsquo;s jealousy of Virginia&rsquo;s welfare appeared
in 1755 when the question of Braddock&rsquo;s route
from Alexandria to Fort Cumberland arose. It would
seem to us today that conditions in Virginia must have
been pitiable if the marching of an army through the
colony could have been considered in any way a boon.
Yet such was Washington&rsquo;s attitude in 1755 toward the
Governor of Maryland&rsquo;s new road. In a letter to Lord
Fairfax dated May 5, 1755, Washington objected to
Dunbar&rsquo;s regiment marching to Cumberland by way of
Frederick, Maryland; in a letter to Major Carlisle written
from Fort Cumberland May 14, 1755, he ridicules
the route: &ldquo;Dunbar had to recross [the Potomac] at
Connogagee [Williamsport, Maryland] and come down
[into Virginia]&mdash;laughable enough.&rdquo;</p></div>
